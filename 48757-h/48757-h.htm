<h1>IRELAND.</h1>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> interesting country becoming every day more and
more the subject of inquiry and personal investigation, an
<span class="smcap">Hibernian Tourist's Guide</span> consequently forms a necessary
adjunct to our original plan. In prosecuting this
design, our object is, by method and selection, to enable
even the casual six-weeks visitant to explore readily the
most important and curious specimens of nature and art,
and that without subjecting him to those travelling inconveniences
which it has been too much the fashion to complain
of. Whilst travelling, at all times and in all countries,
the tourist must learn to suffer petty vexations, privations,
and delays; but a very amusing ramble may be executed
in Ireland, without more of these than the usual share.
The <span class="smcap">MEANS OF CONVEYANCE</span> are now varied, extensive,
rapid, and generally convenient; not only from the capital
in all directions, but also by means of provincial coaches
diverging from all the principal points; whilst good roads
and improving inns give facility and comfort to those who
travel with their own horses and carriages. In some places
also, the <span class="smcap">INLAND NAVIGATION</span> affords a change of scenery
and of general amusement to the <i>independent</i> traveller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ireland</span>, being only about 300 miles in length, and
200 in breadth, containing 30,370 sq. m.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, does not require
a long period to traverse its most important routes. Its <span class="smcap">Climate</span>
is good, with a mean temperature from 48 to 52; its
face mostly level, but with extensive ranges of mountainous
tracts and rocky soil. It contains romantic <span class="smcap">Lakes</span>, both
fresh and salt, viz. <i>Neagh</i>, <i>Erne</i>, <i>Killarney</i>, <i>Swilly</i>, <i>Foyle</i>,
<i>Corrib</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.; also many majestic <span class="smcap">Rivers</span>, <i>Shannon</i>,
<i>Liffy</i>, <i>Boyne</i>, <i>Blackwater</i>, <i>Suir</i>, <i>Barrow</i>, <i>Lagan</i>, &amp;c. Its
<span class="smcap">Mountainous Tracts</span> are principally in Donnegal and Tyrone
in the north, with part of Antrim; also the Mourne
Mountains in Down; the mountains of Wicklow; in
Kerry, and the s.w.; together with the extensive ranges
to the west of the Shannon. The <span class="smcap">Bogs</span> are extensive, occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
many of the mountains, indeed often undulating in hill
and dale, particularly in Donnegal; whilst both they and the
dry heaths are covered with wild myrtles, sedgy grass,
rushes, <i>saggons</i>, or iris, orchis, wild rockets, &amp;c. Of its
<span class="smcap">Forests</span> few remain, being now sunk under the turf-bogs
or peat mosses; yet of minor <span class="smcap">Botany</span> there is a great field
for examination in the Eric&aelig;, numerous alpine plants, and
wild flowers on the heaths, bogs, and rocky fastnesses. Its
<span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span> is very varied, from the gold mines of Wicklow,
down to the silver mines of the same county, those of copper
at Cronbane, with marble, coal, slate; whilst its <span class="smcap">Mineral
Springs</span>, vitriolic, alkaline, saline, sulphureous, &amp;c. offer
frequent opportunities of analysis to the man of science.</p>

<p>The importance of any plan which will tempt Englishmen
of fortune, especially the members of the legislative
body, to visit Ireland, cannot be more clearly expressed than
in Mr. Wakefield's introduction to his work on that country,
where he observes, that a knowledge of the natural
situation, of the political institutions, and of the local advantages
even of a foreign nation, form an object of considerable
magnitude, and must to an inquiring and enlightened
mind be a source of no small gratification; but to become
acquainted with these relations, as they respect the
great divisions of the empire of which we are ourselves
subjects, is of much greater importance.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tread the green sod of <i>Erin</i>, without
a considerable portion of antiquarian enthusiasm,&mdash;at least
not to traverse her wilds, without a portion of that spirit,
even though we may be tempted to deny that extreme
antiquity of record drawn from the earliest periods, and
claimed by the <i>Old Irish</i> in the indulgence of their national
vanity. But the true enthusiast requires not always absolute
historical proof to justify his feelings; and it is well
that he does not; for then many of his a&euml;rial pictures must
fade from existence; and the sober truth certainly is, as the
elaborate Leland has expressed himself, that it cannot
be denied that no literary monuments, to confirm tradition,
have yet been discovered in Ireland earlier than the introduction
of Christianity into that country; and that the evidence
of any transactions previous to that period, rests entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
on the credit of Christian writers, and their collections
from old poets, or their transcripts of records deemed to
have been made in times of paganism. It seems indeed,
as he adds, unreasonable to expect that any other domestic
evidence of Irish antiquity should subsist at this day; but
from these the antiquary forms a regular history of a long
succession of kings and of romantic events from the earlier
ages of the world. Still do these details impart considerable
interest to the scenes where they are supposed to have
been acted; and from the poetical annals that furnish the
catalogue of monarchs, we have a lively picture of manners,
most certainly of great antiquity, however low we reduce
the scale of chronology, and highly worthy of attention,
even though we smile at the tales connected with them,
with a most profuse intermixture of giants, necromancers,
obscure allegories, and extravagant fables. In those annals,
we have an animated picture of a brave people, driven
from their native land in search of new settlements, establishing
themselves by their valour in a fair and fertile
island; the chieftains parcelling out lands to their attendants,
and the whole collection of adventurers, from the moment
of their peaceful establishment, devising means to
give stability to their acquisitions. As a bond of unity to
the whole, they elect a monarch; but preserve their own
individual sovereignty in their domains, forming a complete
feudal system, and filling the land with little courts where
politeness and chivalry, attended by poetry and romance,
went hand in hand. Such is the sketch which arises from
Leland's masterly delineation; who adds, that in this state
of things a robust frame of body, a vehemence of passion,
an elevated imagination, were the characteristics of the
people; whilst noble instances of valour, generous effusions
of benevolence, ardent resentments, desperate and vindictive
outrages, abound in their annals. From hence too it
is that scarcely a romantic dell or simple green knoll exists
without its traditionary tale; sometimes stained with blood,
but as often enlivened by love&mdash;for to verse and music they
were particularly addicted. Hence arose that peculiar turn
of character by which those who are possessed of any superior
degree of knowledge, they who operate on their
fancies and passions by the liveliest strains of poetry, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
long been held in extraordinary veneration; and hence,
even at the present day, the ministers of their religion are
accounted more than human. The effects of those early
events may indeed still be traced by the modern tourist;
and even the historian of cotemporary transactions is obliged
to coincide with the elegant Littleton when he observes,
that the songs of the bard had usually more power
to incite and inflame, than the music of the harp to soften
or mitigate the ferocity of the chief; so that even this recreation,
which seems to indicate something gentle and approaching
to politeness in the temper of the Irish, contributed
to keep up that turbulent spirit, averse to order and
peace, which no prince or legislator that their country ever
produced, had sufficient skill to control. But still, from
the remnants of these ancient customs will the modern
tourist derive considerable advantages, and from none more
than their proverbial hospitality, if he himself has sense
enough to keep it within bounds of propriety. Of this hospitality
much arises from the natural temper of the people;
much from the natural curiosity connected with the arrival
of a stranger in a district where intercourse is unfrequent;
and some portion perhaps derivable from ancient custom;
for, as Leland observes, hospitality was not only a principal
virtue amongst these rude people, but was even enjoined
by law; and as neither lords nor tenants were bound to
each other, as the whole tribe might migrate to some more
favourable district, the ancient <i>Brehon</i> laws expressly stipulate
that no rath shall break up suddenly, lest the traveller
should be disappointed of his expected reception.
But neither the duties to be received by the lord, nor the
entertainment he was to expect from his inferiors, were
determined by his arbitrary will and pleasure. They
were proportioned to the benefits received from him&mdash;nay,
even the lowest of the people claimed reception and refreshment
by an almost perfect right; and so ineffectual is
the flux of many centuries to efface the ancient manners of
a people, that at this day the wandering beggar enters the
house of a farmer or gentleman with as much ease and
freedom as an inmate. From this strict adherence to old
customs, it arose that even on the introduction of Christianity,
many of the Pagan and Druidical ceremonies of religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
interwoven with secular ordinances, were preserved
throughout the island. Indeed, as the author already quoted
very justly affirms, the first Christian missionaries seem to
have industriously avoided all unnecessary violence to the
ancient manners of their converts; favouring and protecting
their poets; avoiding all persecution towards the remains
of the Druidical order; and even whilst thundering
the divine vengeance against the worshippers of the sun,
moon, stars, and wind, yet exercising indulgence towards
many remains of Pagan superstition. In consequence of
this, the inquisitive tourist will find many vestiges of those
superstitions even in the most enlightened parts of the
kingdom, where their origin is unknown or forgotten; and
they are complied with in conformity to general custom, or
prompted by the association of early ideas and prejudices.
Of these the most conspicuous are the fires still lighted up
at particular times, remnants of the worship of Baal or
Apollo; the collecting oaken sprigs in May, a Druidical
rite; and many others, which cannot fail to interest the observer.</p>

<p>As the inquisitive traveller will doubtless make statistical
observations in his progress through the country, the following
quotation from Mr. Wakefield's multifarious and
very intelligent work may form the basis of a series of reasoning
highly deserving the attention of the politician.
Speaking of the county of Louth, vol. 2. p. 616, he says&mdash;"This
county has two large towns, one of which, Drogheda,
is of considerable extent, but its inhabitants are remarkably
poor. To those who have compared this place
with Belfast, where the population is nearly the same, the
difference must be very striking; and nothing can more
clearly evince the superior condition of the Protestants
over that of the Catholics, there being as many Protestants
in Belfast as there are Catholics in Drogheda. The humbler
classes of the Protestants are ashamed to be seen dirty,
or with bad clothes; but, being so much outnumbered,
they in consequence find very little society amongst persons
of their own faith, and have a stronger propensity to
emigrate."&mdash;This pictorial contrast of two towns is, in fact,
but a picture of the whole island. Let the tourist then
examine the Protestant and Catholic districts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
impartiality&mdash;let him closely examine from what it is that the
Catholics require to be <i>emancipated</i>! We do not anticipate&mdash;we
are of no party; but the inquiry is of consequence
and deserves attention, especially at a moment when the
question of Emancipation is likely again to become a subject
of parliamentary and public discussion.</p>

<p>To do justice to that subject requires facts, and not mere
abstract reasoning. It cannot be the wish of any liberal
Protestant to retain the Roman Catholics under undue subjection;
but liberality has its bounds; and though a misplaced
philanthropy may render us careless respecting our
own individual rights, yet it must be remembered that it
cannot justify us in yielding up the rights and the security
of others. As far as <i>Catholic Emancipation</i>, as it is called,
is consistent with <i>Protestant Security</i>, so far it is not only
right but just and prudent to concede; but before <i>Protestant
Ascendancy</i> is given up, let us be certain, from an accurate
investigation of facts, that <i>Protestant Security</i> will remain
inviolate. Let us examine the history of past times;
and also examine mankind at the present day, with a strict
reference to it. This cannot be done in a closet or editorial
apartment in the metropolis; he who would investigate
surely, and therefore safely, must visit the spot where, and
the people by whom, these claims are made.</p>

<p>Again, we say, that it is not our wish to anticipate; but
facts may be recorded. If the tourist ascertains that the
Roman Catholic districts of Ireland are in greater penury
than those where Protestantism predominates, he will not
attribute that in the first instance to Protestant ascendancy,
until he has examined the facts before his eyes. He will
see that industry is the great agent in the one case; the
want of it, the great and immediate agent in the other.
Here then is a point for him from whence to start in his
moral investigations; and he will at once observe, that in
the Protestant districts six days in each week are dedicated
to labour, and the sabbath dedicated to the offices of religion;
whilst in other districts half the week is passed in
the idleness or dissipation of holidays, and the sabbath
neglected. It is true that in the breasts of the Irish Catholics
he will find a strong sense of religion, agreeable to
their modes of faith and ceremony; but he will also find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that those modes of faith and ceremony are subversive of
the spirit of industry, whose stream to be generally useful
must not be dammed up at particular points, and suffered
to run waste at others. But let not the writer of these
sheets be misunderstood. Though fully impressed with
the truth and justice of the foregoing observations, it is far
from his wish to throw any obstacles in the way of the Catholic
Faith. That Faith is free and unshackled, as far as
regards God and man; if political restrictions still exist,
they exist upon an impression that to do them away must
be injurious to Protestantism. To adduce the reasons for
that impression would be beyond our limits, and beyond
our plan; but until that impression is proved to be groundless,
unlimited concession must be withheld. The true
and liberal philanthropist will also inquire whether, under
the peculiar circumstances of their religion, the great body
of the Irish Catholics would absolutely be benefited by an
accordance with the claims set up. Until that be ascertained,
he will pause; and though he may deprecate any
thing like coercion, he will still be careful to avoid any
thing like encouragement, until he is convinced that its results
will at least be harmless.</p>

<p>To form an accurate judgement on these points demands
an Irish tour. The conviction on his own mind which the
editor has here hazarded, without any wish to prejudge the
case in the minds of others, is not formed on slight grounds.
An early acquaintance with that island, and subsequent
rambles over most parts of it, joined to actual observation
in many parts of Europe, and indeed in the four quarters
of the globe, have convinced him that wherever Protestantism
exists, with some very few exceptions, there are to
be found cleanliness, comfort, and industry:&mdash;the reverse
of the picture, though he would be supported in it by the
unanimous assent of many continental travellers, he will
not attempt to draw. Let him who doubts, and who
chooses to make the Irish tour, examine these hints, and
compare them with actual observation. It is true wisdom
to learn from experience and observation&mdash;it is true candour
to acknowledge error when facts judiciously examined
and liberally contrasted lead to truth; and the editor's wish
will be fully answered, if these expressed opinions, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
right or wrong, shall prompt the minds of his readers to
that judicious and liberal examination. In either case the
result must be beneficial to the empire; and the notice
here taken of the very interesting subject, it is hoped, will
neither be considered illiberal or misplaced. But it is now
time to enter into details of the more prominent objects of
curiosity to the tourist; and it must be acknowledged,
with respect to our sister island, that, in taking a general
view of its</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="Antiquities" id="Antiquities"></a>ANTIQUITIES,</h3>

<p>we have not the same facility of correct chronological specification,
as in our general introduction to this work; for
the antiquarian disputes, still unsettled, claim different
dates for many of the most interesting objects. We may
however premise, that the order in which the island has
been peopled and colonized is generally agreed upon to
commence with the <span class="smcap">Celtes</span>, <span class="smcap">Scythi</span>, and <span class="smcap">Firbolgs</span>; then
the <span class="smcap">Ph&#339;nicians</span> and <span class="smcap">Milesians</span> in the south; the <span class="smcap">Romans</span>,
perhaps in a small degree; the <span class="smcap">Scots</span> in the north;
the <span class="smcap">Danes</span> and <span class="smcap">Ostmen</span>; the <span class="smcap">English</span> invaders in the
time of Henry II., followed by the <span class="smcap">Scottish</span> and <span class="smcap">English</span>
colonists of James I., and during the civil wars.</p>

<p>It has even been supposed that the diversities of natural
character, at the present day, in some measure illustrate
the generally received chronological and topographical arrangement.
Ledwich in his introduction to <i>Grose's Antiquities</i>,
considers the <span class="smcap">Celtes</span> as the primeval possessors of
the country;&mdash;all under the system of Druidism, living a
sylvan life, and worshipping the Deity in oaken groves,
wherefore few memorials of them are left. In the north
are to be traced, from the earliest ages, the <span class="smcap">Scoti</span>; in the
south, the <span class="smcap">Firbolgs</span>, then the <span class="smcap">Milesians</span>, and also the
<span class="smcap">Ph&#339;nicians</span> about two centuries before Christ; there
also, according to Ptolemy, were the <span class="smcap">Menapii</span> and <span class="smcap">Brigantes</span>;
and the <span class="smcap">Rhobogdii</span>, <span class="smcap">Darni</span>, &amp;c. in the north, of
a later date than the first <span class="smcap">Scoti</span>, or <span class="smcap">Indo-Scythi</span>, agreeable
to Vallancey's theory. From these and other local circumstances
connected with Ireland, there are few antiquities
of very ancient date, with the exception of rude memorials,
because nothing but wood was used in building until the
11th or 12th century; for until then, stone was only employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in funeral monuments, or <i>Cairns</i>, in <i>Cromlechs</i>, and
sometimes in the <i>Barrows</i>, <i>Raths</i>, and <i>Danish forts</i>; also
in the <i>Round Towers</i>, if their antiquity is so great as some
writers suppose. Of the antiquities of modern date, the
greatest number consist of <i>Castles</i>, <i>Churches</i>, and <i>Monasteries</i>,
principally to be found within the limits of the ancient
English Pale. This is evident from what Sir John
Davis asserts&mdash;"Yet, which is strange to be related, they
did never build any houses of brick or stone, some few poor
religious houses excepted, before the reign of Henry II."</p>

<p>Of the earlier English antiquities, those consist of <span class="smcap">Cathedrals</span>,
<span class="smcap">Churches</span>, and <span class="smcap">Castles</span>; some few Saxon, (at
Kilcullen, Co. Kildare, and Disert, Co. Clare,) some Norman,
but principally of later date.</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">DRUIDICAL MONUMENTS</p>

<p>are very numerous, particularly in some parts of the north.
Dr. Drummond, in the scientific notes to his interesting
poem on the Giant's Causeway, says that "numerous monuments
of the Druidical superstition are still to be seen
in the County of Antrim." The appearance of those agrees
with the description in Mallet's <i>Northern Antiquities</i>; and
also with the quotation from Wormius, copied by Ledwich,&mdash;"The
structure of our altars is various; but generally
a tumulus is formed, on whose summit three great
stones are erected, and on them a fourth broader and more
flat is laid, so that it exactly appears like a rude huge table
resting on three feet." We may add, in respect to
these</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="cromlechs" id="cromlechs">CROMLECHS,</a></p>

<p>That both in Ireland and in Scandinavia, their erection is
vulgarly ascribed to giants; an unerring mark, says Ledwich,
of their Gothic origin. Sir R. C. Hoare says that
the construction of stone temples and cromlechs has generally
been attributed to the Druids, but without any certainty
of proof. He also hazards the conjecture, and with
great plausibility, that a temple like Stonehenge once existed
on the Curragh of Kildare (See Tour in Ireland,
p. 274.) Coeval with <i>Cromlechs</i>&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but absolutely
so in the opinion of Ledwich, are the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CAIRNS,</p>

<p>Rude heaps of stones, composed partly also of earth, forming
immense conical heaps, and evidently sepulchral.
These are very numerous, and are generally erected on the
summits of hills; but, though some of them may be Druidical,
the greater part are of later date.</p>

<p>Sir R. C. Hoare considers the Irish Cairn or Carnedd
to be of the same origin as the Barrow or Tumulus in various
parts of England.</p>

<p>Under the period now treated of we may also enumerate
the sculptured stones bearing</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ogham" id="ogham">OGHAM INSCRIPTIONS,</a></p>

<p>which Vallancey describes as ancient Irish, or Indo-Scythian
remains. These are found in many parts of the
island; one of the most curious of which is at Tory-hill,
Co. Kilkenny, inscribed to the God <i>Belus</i> or <span class="smcap">Baal</span>. They
are very numerous in Co. Kerry. These and the ancient
<i>Irish Letters</i> have given rise to more controversy than any
other subject connected with Hibernian antiquities. In
Miss Plumptre's <i>Tour</i>, p. 327 et seq., the curious reader
will find much information, with good references to further
analysis. Of the remains of the <i>Ph&#339;nician</i> era, we may
perhaps specify the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ancient" id="ancient">ANCIENT TEMPLES,</a></p>

<p>one of which, the <span class="smcap">Ship Temple</span> near Dundalk, is attributed
by Vallancey to that people, or else to the sea
rovers, <i>Victi</i>, or <i>Picts</i>, who paid divine honours to the form
of a ship; but Governor Pownal supposed it to be the work
of the <span class="smcap">Nani</span>, a northern or Scandinavian nation.</p>

<p>That the Ph&#339;nicians or Carthaginians must have visited
Ireland, is supported by Miss Plumptre upon the ground
that amongst the relics of antiquity in possession of the
Dublin Society are several heads of axes which were dug
up in the south, corresponding exactly with some that have
been found in the plain of Cann&aelig; and in Egypt, and which
are considered as Carthaginian. This, she adds, seems
strongly to corroborate the idea that the Carthaginians, the
most adventurous navigators of ancient days, actually
traded to Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Cotemporary with these are many of the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CAVES,</p>

<p>evidently artificial, which served as habitations to the rude
colonists. Many of these remain, in the north, on the
sides of hills almost inaccessible, and are vulgarly called
"Picts Caves" at the present day. Neat in chronological
order to those are the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="round" id="round">ROUND TOWERS,</a></p>

<p>Conical erections, tall and slender, so frequently found adjoining
to, or nearly in contact with, the ancient churches.
Those antiquaries who give them a very recent date, suppose
them to be the work of native builders, whilst
the Castles and Churches are by English or French architects:
but Vallancey claims for them a very ancient date,
asserting that they were erected by the Ph&#339;nicians to contain
the sacred fire, and copied from the pyramidal stones
so frequent with that people and with the Druids. Ledwich,
however, merely considers them as common appendages
to the wooden churches; some at a distance of 8
feet, others 124; and one, at <i>St. Kevins</i>, actually joined to
it. This latter writer assumes that they are <i>Ostmanic</i>, or
Danish productions, "and from uninterrupted tradition,
probably to have been belfries from the beginning." Of
these about sixty-six remain. Except as to rotundity, every
architect seems to have followed his own fancy both in
height and in internal arrangement: the one at Antrim is
80 feet high, tapers about 18 feet from the top in form of a
sugar-loaf, where it is about 36 feet in girth, and 52 near
the base; some have their door 24 feet from the ground,
but in general not more than 10 or 12. The Tower at
Drumiskin is supposed to have been the highest in the
island, upwards of 130 feet, and nearly equalled by those at
Kildare and Kilkenny. That at Kilmacduagh in Galway is
110 feet, with the door 24 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Much controversy has existed respecting the origin of
these round edifices. The first writer who mentions them
is <i>Giraldus Cambrensis</i>, who certainly calls them "Ecclesiastical
Towers;" and some writers go so far as to assert,
from the grammatical construction of the sentence in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he describes them, that he saw the builders in the very act
of raising them, in 1185. This at least is certain, that they
were so early in existence; but Lynch, who wrote in 1662,
asserts that they were erected by the Danes, as early as
838; in which he is followed by Peter Walsh, also by Molyneux
in 1727, who ascribes them to the Ostmen or Danes,
but supposes them to be of later date than the Raths and
other earthen works, and erected solely as Bell Towers for
calling the people of large districts to join in religious ordinances.
But there are some circumstances which militate
against that opinion, whilst others seem to confirm it.
At the Giant's Ring in the County of Down, we have an
instance of a Round Tower on a spot manifestly of Druidical
superstition, without any Church in its vicinity; as if the
churches were built near to the Towers, instead of these
being built near to the churches, the early preachers of
Christianity choosing to erect their new religious edifices
on spots already consecrated in the eyes of the people. It
must be acknowledged, however, that when the Round
Tower at Downpatrick was pulled down in 1790, whilst
repairing the cathedral, its foundation being cleared away,
another foundation was discovered under it, and running
directly across the site of the tower, which appeared to be
a continuation of the church wall, and which, at some period
prior to the building of that tower, seemed to have extended
considerably beyond it. Further, that these towers,
sometimes at least, had a connexion with Christianity, is
evident from the fact of some of them being built upon
vaults belonging to the churches; and on more than one,
in the north of Ireland, may be traced the figure of the
cross. One instance of this may be seen on the keystone
of the door of the tower at Donoghmore. On the other
hand, in regard to the tower at Drumbo, it is evident that
at some former time, very strong fires have been burned
within that building, and the inside surface, towards the
bottom, has the appearance of vitrification. Indeed it is a
fact recorded in the <i>Down Survey</i>, p. 290, that the ground
floors of many towers have been opened, where the ashes
of burnt wood have been found, supposed by some antiquaries
to be the remains of the perpetual fire once kept burning
there in honour of the Sun. It is also recorded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Pennant, in his <i>View of Hindostan</i>, that the Pagodas, in
the Circars, resembled the Round Towers, with tops
pointed or truncated, and ornamented with a round ball to
represent the Sun as an emblem of the deity of that temple.
The idea of their being Christian penitentiaries seems
at first sight to be whimsical; yet it is said that there are
manuscripts in existence which prove it with respect to
some of them. One of these manuscripts records the building
of a tower at Kinath, in Cork County, in the year
1015; whilst the tower at Ardmore in Waterford has evidently
been used as a belfry.</p>

<p>An idea is started in the <i>Kilkenny Survey</i>, p. 632, that
they are connected with pilgrimages; a pilgrimage being
called <i>Turrish</i> in Irish, as if in allusion to their Latin appellation
of <i>Turris</i>.</p>

<p>Of other facts connected with them, it may be recorded
that at Tulloher in Kilkenny, where the tower is only
8 feet from the church, yet that edifice is of limestone,
whilst the tower itself is of siliceous breccia.</p>

<p>That some of them are comparatively of recent erection
is evident from the fact that at Roscrea in Tipperary, the
tower has a pointed or Gothic arch, 38 feet from the
ground. Now the 12th century is generally allowed to be
the era of the introduction of the Gothic architecture into
this country; and from this a curious question arises. It
is moreover a curious fact, not hitherto noticed by any
writer upon this subject, that the isolated tower, probably
of Moorish origin, which stands on the neutral ground at
Gibraltar, bears a very striking resemblance, in all points,
to the Irish round towers in general. This tower has been
seen and examined by the editor, who was much struck by
the similarity at the time, and has since endeavoured to
procure all possible information upon the subject. It is
well known that Gibraltar was not inhabited by the Ph&#339;nicians,
Carthaginians, nor Romans, nor even by the Visigoths,
but was first taken possession of by the Saracens in
711; fourteen years after which the Moorish castle was
built, followed by other edifices, with the pointed Saracenic
arch, until the rock returned to the dominion of Spain in
1462. It may be added here, that the Irish towers have a
strong resemblance to the Oriental minarets, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their supposed use as places for calling the people to worship.
Where there are so many and so discordant opinions
it is difficult to decide; but the tourist may avail himself of
these hints in his further researches.</p>

<p>Of the precise antiquity of the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">RATHS,</p>

<p>or Danish Mounts, few doubts exist. These are circular
mounts of earth, from 40 to 150 feet in diameter at the
base, and conically diminishing towards the top. Common
tradition gives them to the <span class="smcap">Danes</span>; and no doubt a great
proportion of them are not older than the occupation of the
northern and eastern coasts by the Ostmen. But some
must be of the earliest Scandinavian date; particularly the
<i>Giant's Ring</i> near Belfast, and the <i>Rough Fort</i> near Templepatrick,
which have Druidical remains incorporated with
them, and in their very centre. Besides, though the term
<i>Danish</i> is universally applied to these works, yet some of
them are also undoubtedly <i>Norwegian</i>, particularly one
near Fore in Westmeath, called the "Fort of Turgesius,"
positively described by <i>Giraldus</i> as the work of a Norwegian
chieftain, and raised for a castle, using the word
"Castella," and not <i>Castrum</i>.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject of the <i>Raths</i>, it may be useful
to notice Ledwich's observations on that subject. Quoting
Giraldus, The Irish, says he, had no castles, their woods
served them for camps, and their marshes for ditches. It
was Turgesius and his Ostmen who formed that infinite
number of earthen forts and castles made of lime and
stone. It is then to those northern invaders that Giraldus
ascribes the high round earthen forts with deep ditches
and often triple entrenchments. This is certainly in opposition
to Mr. Harris, who argues for their Celtic origin,
reasoning principally on the name of <i>rath</i> being of Celtic
derivation. It has also been supposed that they may have
been introduced by the Belgic colonists, as the name has
some appearance of Teutonic origin. These raths are generally
upon elevated spots, and of various dimensions,
from 10 or 15 yards diameter, to an extent of 18 or 20 acres.
Some of them have subterraneous chambers, with sally-ports;
some are round, others square; the former supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by Spencer to be Danish, the latter Saxon. They
are sometimes called <i>Motes</i>, a Gothic word signifying the
place of meeting; and indeed it has been supposed that
many of them were intended rather for civil legislation, or
judicial purposes, than as works of military defence. These
Raths, together with the <i>Duns</i>, or inclosures upon insulated
rocks, and the <i>Daingeans</i>, or inclosures formed by
deep ditches with ramparts and pallisadoes, are supposed
by Ledwich to have been the only forts amongst the Irish
antecedent to the invasion by the Norman barons in the
reign of Henry II. In many parts of the island, the Irish
chiefs had an inveterate dislike to fixed fortifications&mdash;one
cogent reason why scarcely any castles exist except of
English erection; a fact well illustrated by an anecdote of
the famous De Courcy, who constructed two castles in <i>Mac
Mahon's</i> country, a step which awed the latter into complaisance;
and he having sworn fidelity, De Courcy bestowed
on him the two castles with their appendant lands.
But within a month Mac Mahon demolished both; and, on
being asked his reason for doing so, replied that "he did
not promise to hold stones but land; and that it was contrary
to his nature to live within cold walls whilst the
woods were so nigh."</p>

<p>It has often occurred to the writer of these sheets, from
actual observation of some hundreds of these <i>mounds</i>, that
the term "Rath," as generally applied, is often erroneous.
Wolff in his Dictionary positively states the word "Raad"
in the Danish language to signify a council; of course, by
a common figure of rhetoric, putting the thing for the
place, or the place for the thing, this term is properly applied
to the larger eminences, some of which are as extensive
as old Sarum, and therefore well adapted for assemblies
of the people. But Lloyd, in his Dictionary of the
Irish-English Language, considers the word even more figuratively,
saying that it means a village, a prince's seat, also
an artificial mount, or barrow. Now the fact is, that many
of the smaller mounts, where placed singly, may be, and
some of them by opening have been proved to be, <i>Tumuli</i>,
or sepulchral monuments; but others, placed in lines of
communication for miles together, for they are never found
in groups as upon Salisbury plain, were evidently for exploratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
purposes or chains of military posts, a most remarkable
instance of which may be seen on the road from
Belfast towards Templepatrick, where there is a line of
them within sight of each other for several miles, leading
through the valley of communication from Belfast Lough
towards Lough Neagh, between the Cave Hill and Carnmoney
mountain, and connected with the very curious
mount at the Rough Fort, which looks down upon a bog
called King's Moss at the foot of the Carrantoll mountains,
in the centre of which is a most extensive Rath, about 10
yards high, and at least 60 in diameter, with a raised bank
round its summit faced with rough stones towards the area.
Part of one side having been broken into, it seemed as if
the whole had been raised upon rough stone-work, the materials
for which must have been brought from a considerable
distance. These, both large and small, are sometimes
called moats; and some, of the largest size, are designated
by the appellation of Dun or Doon.</p>

<p>We now come to monuments of more recent date, of
which the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">RELIGIOUS ANTIQUITIES</p>

<p>deserve the first consideration; and of these some</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="churches" id="churches">Churches</a></span> may perhaps be as old as the 11th or 12th century,
and not earlier; for although many were built immediately
after the conversion by St. Patrick, about five centuries
after <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, yet all these were simply of wood or
wattled, and therefore long extinct. Along with these we
may class the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cells</span> and <span class="smcap">Hermitages</span>, rude and composed of upright
stones with an impost, where saints led an eremitic life,
perhaps sometimes adapting the older Druidical cromlechs
to their more modern purposes, just in the same manner as
several of the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crosses</span> are supposed by Ledwich to have been carved
upon the ancient upright pyramidal stones of pagan idolaters.
These Crosses have neither that light and taper
form nor elegant Gothic workmanship which distinguish
our ancient specimens in England; but though simple in
design they are yet rich in sculpture. Sir R. C. Hoare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thinks them coeval with the Round Towers, about the 9th
or 10th century.</p></blockquote>

<p>This part of the subject must not be dismissed without
some notice of the stone-roofed Chapels of the ancient
Irish, which Ledwich considers as exhibiting, along with
other remains, some ideas of the Egyptian and Grecian
styles of architecture; in which opinion he is more than
sanctioned both by O'Halloran and Archdall, who claim an
early knowledge of architecture for the aboriginal Irish.
Mr. Ledwich, however considers these as the first specimens
of stone and mortar ever seen in the island; as raised
by the Ostmen, and intended solely for the preservation of
reliques. Several of these present themselves to the tourist
as objects of curiosity. One may be seen near the cathedral
of Killaloe, supposed to have been the depository
of the reliques of St. Flannan. The tourist in Ireland cannot
fail to be struck with the number of monastic remains,
of which the churches or chapels are mostly standing,
though unroofed and in ruins. These he will always find
surrounded by crowded cemeteries; and Sir R. C. Hoare
observes that he was informed the great frequency of the
fact proceeds from the consolidation of parishes at a period
when the Catholic predominated over the Protestant religion.
He adds, in direct opposition to modern assertions,
that the latter now begins to gain ground, as application
has been made for the restoration of many of those dilapidated
churches, and some have already been rebuilt. Of
these ancient specimens, some few are of Saxon architecture,
particularly Kilsheel church in Tipperary, having a
Saxon doorway, once rich in sculpture, but now defaced.
In general the Church ruins consist of little more than the
shell of a small edifice with two gable ends and scarcely any
windows, always enveloped in ivy: in some places they
appear at distances of every 4 or 5 miles. But Sir R. C.
Hoare remarks, that although monastic architecture may be
inferior to that of the sister kingdoms, yet Ireland, in her
stone-roofed Chapels, Round Towers, and rich Crosses,
may justly boast of singularities unknown and unpossessed
by either of them.</p>

<p>The <i>Church Monuments</i> are by no means so numerous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so ancient as to afford the antiquary, the genealogist, or
the heraldic tourist, that amusement and instruction so
frequent in the ecclesiastical edifices of England. Few antique
monuments remain, and the authenticity of the so
much boasted one of Strongbow, in Christ-church in the
metropolis, is very doubtful. Sir R. C. Hoare has stated,
p. 13, 14, in a note, the evidence for and against it. There
we have the authority of an inscription of the restored monument,
by Sir H. Sydney in 1570; to which Sir Richard
adds a positive assertion of his being buried there, from Giraldus,
but setting against it the "Hic jacet" of a tomb in
Gloucester cathedral, recorded by Leland. Sir Richard,
himself, doubts the fact of Strongbow having been buried in
Dublin, as we do also, but not precisely for the same reason.
Sir Richard's doubt springs from the circumstance
of the knight on the Christ-church monument bearing a
shield argent, on a chief azure three cross crosslets fitch&eacute;e;
whilst the family coat of the <i>De Clares</i>, Earls of Pembroke,
were Or, 3 chevrons gules. But the fact is, that
at the time in question there was a great license in the
assumption of coat armour, then just beginning to be hereditary;
and indeed there are frequent instances at that
period of individuals adopting new coats for particular purposes.
The present case is an instance of it; for the coat
with the crosses was actually assumed by Gilbert, father
of Strongbow, on his return from the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The remaining objects of antiquarian research are the</p>


<p class="ph3" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CASTLES,</p>

<p>which are of various dates. Some of these may be as old
as the 11th or 12th century, perhaps older, as it is said
that the Scandinavian chiefs introduced stone into their
fortified places, and there are several Norwegian <i>round
Castles</i> still extant. Ledwich divides them into several
eras; first, <i>old Danish forts</i> surrounded with earthen
works, to which was afterwards added a keep of stone and
lime, and sometimes a circular wall; then piles of building
encompassed by a rampart, afterwards called a <i>Bawn</i>,
and imitated by later colonists; then houses with battlements
and turrets, flankers, &amp;c. Of all these there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
great variety, as well as number; and the author quoted
is of opinion, that all the castles constructed by British
settlers were by British architects.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of these will be found described in
the following sheets.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the <span class="smcap">MINERALOGIST</span> does not find so great a variety of
substances to repay his research as he may do in most parts
of the sister-island of Great Britain, yet the geologist will
discover many leading features upon a large scale that deserve
his attention. Hitherto the little notice that has been
taken on these two subjects, of the soil of Ireland, both superficial
and fossil, has been in regard to agricultural purposes;
but from casual discoveries hitherto made, there
seems reason to hope that an accurate mineralogical research
will be both interesting to science and beneficial in
political and domestic economics. So far as general examination
has yet gone, and in order to offer some leading
hints to the scientific inquirer, it may be observed, that
sandy soils, such as are frequent in England, are seldom
seen except in maritime situations; but there are many inland
beds of a red substance, too soft to be called stone,
yet too compact to be called sand, though perfectly reducible
to that state by the action of the sun or artificial heat.
This however generally, if not always, lies below a thin
stratum of soil more congenial to vegetation. Of argillaceous
earths, clay is not uncommon, but seldom at the
surface, and never so tenacious as in the eastern parts of
England. Pipe-clay is also met with; and an indifferent
kind of fuller's-earth. Calcareous matter is very frequent,
as limestone; but chalk is unknown. Silex is found in
limestone quarries; but the flints are generally in nodules.
Loam is frequent, and now much attended to as a manure
or top dressing. Marble and granite, also specimens of
porphyry, exist in many districts; and the marble quarries
in Kilkenny and Carlow in particular, will not fail to arrest
the attention of the geologist, in consequence of the great
deposition of sea-shells and marine exuvi&aelig; contained in
them. Freestone is also often met with; presenting,
when cut in particular directions, the semblance of fir-deal
in the position of its strata. There is a geological observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
made by the Rev. Mr. Townsend in his Survey of
Cork, which deserves the investigation of the geological
tourist, and may serve to lead him to valuable facts in the
course of his research. That intelligent writer remarks,
that in many of the southern districts, the limits of limestone
tracts are generally marked by the course of a river;
and this he illustrates by the fact that the Blackwater river,
in its course from Fermoy to Mill-street, runs at the south
side of the limestone; whilst, for the far greater part of
the way between Castlemore and Cork, a distance of about
eleven miles, the course of the limestone is distinctly
marked, first by the river Bride, and after its junction with
the Lee, by the latter river. During this space, he states
that the limestone invariably adheres to one side of the
channel, which it follows in all its windings, without ever
crossing it. At Kinmare the same circumstances may be
observed; and also in the county of Waterford, where, however,
the Blackwater runs to the north of its limestone
tract. The bogs are also worthy both of mineralogical
and geological notice; not only on account of the immense
number of fossil oak and yew-trees which they contain;
but also from the fact that many of them which extend for
miles in length, consist, even to a depth of many feet, of
a congeries of branches and twigs of trees, which seem to
have required even a succession of forests for ages to have
supplied them. Of these, perhaps, there can be little doubt
that a great portion are actually antediluvian.</p>

<p>Before entering on this part of the investigation, the
scientific tourist will do well to read Mr. Aiton's pamphlet
on Moss Earth, where he will meet with many interesting
hints for research. Even the antiquary will not pass these
immense tracts unnoticed, since much light has been
thrown upon the earlier periods of Irish history by the discovery
of curious antiques at considerable depths, by the
peat cutters. Some iron heads of arms, wooden bowls,
three sacks full of nuts, and a coat of ancient texture and
construction, were in 1737 dug from under a moss fifteen
feet deep; all of which were in a high state of perfection.
Indeed Mr. Aiton observes, that the singular antiseptic
qualities of moss extend to every thing buried under its
surface. Wood, when exposed to the atmosphere, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
buried under any other earth, will be totally decomposed
or annihilated in a few years; but if it is enveloped in moss
before putrefaction has made much progress upon it, it will
remain but little impaired for many centuries. The underside
of moss timber is generally found entire; and Mr.
Aiton is of opinion, that the progress which corruption has
made on the upper side of many specimens, must have
taken place before the moss, in its progress of growth,
rose above the trees. Facts of this kind may very properly
lead to observations of the means of preventing the
dry rot in timber; and the chemical tourist may devote an
hour most usefully to the analysis of those substances
which are found in the immediate vicinity of those fossil
trees in the highest state of preservation.</p>

<p>Basaltes is another substance which deserves the notice
of the tourist; for, though not peculiar to Ireland, it
is perhaps more interesting here than in any other country,
nature presenting it under the most awful forms; sometimes
piled up in immense structures of stupendous height
and extent, where its columns are arranged in various directions,
as if deposited in regular series by the hand of
men. It is principally however in the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> district that it
is so found, extending from Carrickfergus-bay to Lough-Foyle,
on the sea coast, and inland even to the southern
shores of Lough-Neagh.</p>

<p><a name="granite" id="granite">Granite</a> forms the great bed of Ireland, and is seen
bursting out in all the great ranges of mountains; not
only in the central parts of the kingdom, but also in the
basaltic district.</p>

<p>Ochres, both red and yellow, are found in considerable
quantities in many places. Fuller's-earth has already been
mentioned: there are also several other saponaceous
earths, particularly near the Old-Head of Kinsale in the
county of Cork.</p>

<p>Slates are found in most parts of Ireland; and flag-stones
are worked in great quantities in many districts.</p>

<p>The tourist whose time does not admit of much mineralogical
research, may yet be amply gratified on that subject
whilst in Dublin, by examining the collection at the
Society's house.</p>

<p>Before starting on an Irish tour, the traveller will naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be anxious to know what kind of weather he may
expect. To this we shall answer shortly in the words of
Mr. Aldworth of Cork, in a communication to Mr. Wakefield,
wherein he observes that, as an old agriculturist, he
is inclined to think that less rain falls in the interior of
Ireland than in any of the other British Isles, and yet perhaps
there are more wet days there than in the latter; a
circumstance which certainly interferes with travelling in
an open carriage. As the showers however, though frequent,
are not, generally speaking, of very long duration,
this inconvenience may be easily guarded against. To this
we may add, that the winds which most usually prevail in
Ireland blow from the west: they are mild in their temperature,
and moist in their nature; but far from being
insalubrious. It has also been well observed by the Rev.
Horace Townshend, after a long residence, that along the
sea coast the winter is disarmed of its severity by the softness
of the southern wind, which mitigates the rigour of
the frost, and seldom suffers the heaviest snow to remain
many hours undissolved, except on the north sides of the
high hills. This observation, however, applies principally
to the southern coast; where also the sea breeze tempers
the summer's warmth by its refreshing breath; so that the
greatest degree of heat, as well as cold, is found in the
northern districts of the island. The whole island is remarkably
bare of trees, and exhibits a naked appearance;
which is more striking to a traveller whose eye has been
familiarized to the woody counties of England. Yet the
varied aspect arising from the frequency of sea views, combined
with the rude but grand scenery of the mountains,
and the different tints they assume according to their
distance, produces a number of beautiful and diversified
prospects.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Entomologist</span> will also be certain of finding numerous
sources of amusement. Mr. Hall, in his Tour,
vol. 2. p. 268, asserts that with a tolerable glass, one sees
animals grazing, like cattle in a meadow, on the leaves of
every vegetable, and these also much larger than in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Some tourists have been deterred from penetrating into
the wildest parts of the island, by prejudices founded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
misrepresentation and ignorance; but little cause for alarm
exists if the tourist chooses to conduct himself with a little
civility to the poor ignorant peasantry whom he shall
meet, even in the loneliest places. On this subject, Mr.
Wakefield records the fact, that when in the county of
Mayo, he was advised not to cross a particular district in
his way to Roscommon; he, however, experienced no inconvenience,
except from the hardness of the roads and his
ignorance of the Irish language, there universally spoken.
With respect to the conveniences of travelling, we must
not lead the tourist astray by inducing him to believe that,
except upon the great frequented roads, he will meet with
any thing like the accommodations so general in England.
But if he can patiently bear with minor difficulties, he may
pursue his route over great part of the island by mail and
stage-coaches, and in general by post-chaises, if not provided
with his own horses or carriages. The Inns, indeed,
will often disappoint him, both in accommodation and cleanliness;
yet he may always be certain of clean sheets, and
his culinary comforts are clean, if he can content himself
with plain dishes. Travelling however is so unfrequent,
that in many places, when a visitor does arrive at an inn,
he appears to be considered as an inexhaustible gold mine,
not only by the landlord, but also by the numerous host of
retainers, many of whom he never sees until going away.
Before we take leave of the tourist, it may be proper to
offer him a few hints from Sir R. C. Hoare's Work, which
will be extremely useful to him.</p>

<p>If he chooses to go to the expense of his own carriage
and horses, he will certainly ensure to himself much independence;
especially if he takes care to select a judicious
route. For a party also, this would perhaps be as cheap
a mode as can well be adopted. But if he is a single traveller,
or with one companion, and not averse to pedestrianism,
then he may find a general facility by taking the
direct and cross coaches from station to station, hiring
horses for long excursions, and walking those of a shorter
range. Before leaving Dublin, Belfast, or Waterford, the
three points from whence an English tourist is likely to
start, let him make a fair calculation of time and distance,
allow a certain sum per mile and a certain sum per day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and then supply his purse with the paper and coined currency
most likely to answer in the district he intends to
visit. This he will not find difficult at the places mentioned,
or indeed at any of the larger towns; but let him
be on his guard against bad money and forged notes; and
also, if he has any Irish currency left at the end of his tour,
let him change it for English when setting off to return.</p>

<p>It now only remains to add, that every writer, both ancient
and modern, on the subject of Ireland, has been consulted;
aided by the communications of friends and a general
personal knowledge of the Topography of Ireland on
the part of the Editor.</p>

<p>The tourist will observe that the distances are given in
Irish miles, of which, eleven are equal to fourteen English.
The distances of the county towns from the capital are
taken on the authority of the latest surveys; whilst the
distances in the vicinage of the several stations are from
common computation or from the best maps, and may be
depended on for every useful purpose to the inquisitive
traveller, bearing in mind that bogs and mountains often
render roads circuitous, in which cases local inquiry, and
also for the best roads, will often be beneficial, and sometimes
necessary. Reference to many of the authorities will
be found in the work itself; but it may be added that the
county surveys have been carefully examined and compared
with earlier descriptions, independent of the general
notices from Hoare, Hall, Plumptre, Curwen, Drummond,
Weld, and all the recent topographical works, together
with several recent anonymous tours, whose proved accuracy,
in many points, renders them worthy of notice in all.</p></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A very ingenious friend remarks<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, that almost all our
round towers are divided into stories of different heights;
the floors supported in some by projecting stones, in others,
joists put in the wall at building, and in many they are
placed upon rests. The last are from four to six inches,
carried round and taken off the thickness of the wall in the
story above; and he very probably conjectures that these
rests do not diminish the thickness of the wall as they ascend,
because then it would not have been sufficiently
strong to bear storms or support the conical cap which was
generally solid and heavily constructed. They seem therefore
to be swellings in the wall which rather add to its thickness
upwards, and this Mr. Cooper confirms by the round
tower at <i>Lusk</i>, whose wall is three feet thick at top. <i>Cashel</i>
tower is divided into five stories, with holes for joists.</p>

<p><i>Fertagh</i> has five stories and one rest.&mdash;<i>Kilcullen</i> has
three stories and one rest.&mdash;<i>Kildare</i> has six stories and projecting
stones for each.&mdash;<i>Monasterboice</i> has six stories and
projecting stones.&mdash;<i>Oughterard</i> has five stories and projecting
stones.&mdash;<i>Taghadoe</i> has six stories, the upper has
projecting stones, the others rests.&mdash;<i>Timahoe</i> has seven
stories, the second has projecting stones, the others rests.</p>

<p>The door of <i>Cashel Tower</i> faces the <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, those of <i>Kildare</i>
and <i>Kilkenny</i> the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, and the others vary.</p>

<p>Four small windows were placed at the top of <i>Kells
Tower</i> pointing to the four cardinal points.</p>

<p><i>Kenith Tower</i> stands 124 feet&mdash;<i>Drumbo</i> 20 feet&mdash;<i>Downpatrick</i>
48 feet&mdash;<i>Kildare</i> 90 feet&mdash;<i>Kilkenny</i> 8 feet&mdash;<i>Dromiskin</i>
90 feet, from their respective Churches. <i>Ardmore</i>,
<i>Castledermot</i>, <i>Cloyne</i>, and other <i>Towers</i> were formerly and

<p>42 m. from <span class="smcap">N.</span> to <span class="smcap">S.</span> 24 from <span class="smcap">E.</span> to <span class="smcap">W.</span> containing 430,000 Irish
acres; bounded by the sea on the <span class="smcap">N.</span> and <span class="smcap">E.</span>, by Down on
the <span class="smcap">S.</span> by Lough Neagh and Derry on the <span class="smcap">W.</span> It contains
much diversified scenery; is mountainous on the northern,
and eastern coasts, but extends into fertile plains in the interior.
Its great extent of sea coast affords every variety in
science and the picturesque; mountains wild, covered with
heath and bog, or frowning in abrupt and rugged cliffs; towards
Lough Neagh all the mild beauties of cultivation:
the vale of the Lagan, between Belfast and Lisburn, cannot
be surpassed for beauty, cultivation, elegant villas,
bleach-greens, and comfortable cottages, with all the varieties
of hill, dale, wood, and water, by any tract of equal
extent in the empire. Its ancient inhabitants were the <i>Darni</i>,
succeeded by the <i>Dalriadi</i>, afterwards by the <i>Ostmen</i>, and
finally by English and Scottish settlers. Lofty hills afford
great amusement to the botanist and geologist, particularly
the range near Belfast, amongst which Devis is 1400 ft.
high; the Cave Hill 1140; Carmony 790; and the Knockagh
903. These and others consist principally of a compact body
of limestone rock, over which, extending along the whole
coast as far as the Giant's Causeway, a diffusion of vitrifiable
stone has been superinduced in a state of softness,
now forming a hard basalt, resting generally on a base of
variegated sandstone dipping to the <span class="smcap">W.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Antrim</span>, 16 m. from Belfast, 84 m. from Dublin.&mdash;On
the banks of the Six-mile Water, near its confluence with
Lough Neagh, see the Castle, a seat of the Massarene family.
2 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> ruins of Shane's Castle; near it, the field where
a furious battle was fought in the late rebellion, in which
Lord O'Neil fell by the hand of ingratitude; round tower.
This ancient Castle has lately become a mass of ruins, in
consequence of a most destructive fire; yet it is still worth
visiting, being beautifully seated on the banks of Lough Neagh,
facing the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> the waters of which formerly washed
its walls, but were some years ago fenced off by an embankment,
on which was erected a handsome green-house. Nothing
can be more majestic than the view from the Castle
of the vast expanse of water, and the neighbouring banks
considerably enriched with trees and verdure, through
which are many charming walks and rides. The demesne
and park are of great extent, through which a fine stream
runs, taking its rise from a small lake 10 m. distant. Near
the small lake is an elegant cottage called Remon Lodge,
originally fitted up for retirement and shooting-parties,
shaded with large venerable trees, and altogether a delightful
sequestered spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballinderry</span>, 14 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Belfast.&mdash;Neat village.
Good station for Lough Neagh; ruins of Portmore Castle.

<p><span class="smcap">Ballycastle</span>, 47 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from Belfast.&mdash;Improving
sea-port town, with a Colliery. Ruins of the old Castle;

and Kelp-works: also the ancient Coal-mine or Gallery lately
discovered, supposed to be Danish. Chalybeate Spa. Danish
Raths. Romantic scenery round the cliffs, with Raghery
Island 6 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> in the distant horizon, presenting to
the eye of taste, in a fine evening, a singular prospect, with
its chalky cliffs crowned by a venerable covering of brown
rock, broken into beautiful and picturesque variety by the
turbulent ocean. On the road to Portrush a singular little
fishing rock, always an object of interest to tourists, called
Carrick-a-Rede; connected to the main land by an extraordinary
flying bridge over an abrupt and romantic chasm 60
feet in breadth. See also the White Rocks about 1 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>
from Port Rush, well worth examining, with a beautiful
calcareous fa&ccedil;ade extending about &frac12; a m., capriciously hollowed
into a vast number of magnificent caves of various
sizes. Also the cliffs of Craigmillar. 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> Ardmoy village,
with neat Ch. and curious round tower: on the road
on the right, ruins of an old Castle. See Knocklede, recently
a volcano, and Kinfane Castle.</p>

and the Moravian settlement at Grace-hill. Slemish mountain,
an interesting object. 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> is Clough, a small neat
village. See the Ch., plain but handsome, with ruins of two
Castles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballymony</span>, 23 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from Antrim.&mdash;Thriving village
by linen manufacture. 4 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> village of Dervock,
with the beautiful seats of Belleisle and Cloverhill. 6 m.
<span class="smcap">E.</span> is Lough Guill. See Ch., and Lissanoure Castle on the
banks of the lake, a most romantic mansion and grounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belfast</span>, 84 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from Dublin.&mdash;Flourishing commercial
town at head of Carrickfergus Bay. Elegant Ch. and
Chapel-of-ease. House of Industry. White and brown
Linen-Halls. Academical Institution. Bridge of 21 arches
over Lagan, with romantic prospect of the bay and surrounding
hills. Exchange and Assembly Rooms. Various
charitable Institutions. Philosophical and Musical Societies;
the latter for revival of the Harp. Quays and Docks.
Glass-houses and Iron-founderies. 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> the Cave-hill,
with caves and romantic scenery, and a most extensive prospect
from its summit. Delightful ride towards Carrickfergus,
with numerous seats and villas; several Danish raths,
and the ruins of White Abbey. 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Belfast, near
Ballydrain, is the Giant's Ring, an extensive circular earthen
mound 2256 feet in circumference, with a Druidical Cromlech
in the centre. Near it Collin and Devis mountains,
with ancient caves called the "Picts," and fine view of
Lough Neagh: across the Lagan 3 m. is the elegant seat of
Belvoir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bengore Head</span>,&mdash;the most northern extremity of the
island, and an object in the tour to Giant's Causeway, which
it much resembles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bush Mills</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> from Coleraine.&mdash;The nearest
accommodation for the Giant's Causeway. 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> Ruins
of Dunluce Castle on a romantic cliff. 3&frac12; m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> the seat
of ancient Irish chieftains, and surrounded by the scenery
of Ossian's first poem. Take a boat for view of the coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrickfergus</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Belfast, the county and
assize town.&mdash;Ancient Castle built by Hugh Lacy, Earl of
Ulster, in 1178. Ch. with monuments of the Donnegall
family. New Court-house and Gaol. Some remains of an ancient
monastery: ancient walls and pier where K. William
landed. Romantic scenery towards the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> and Island
Magee, including Castle Dobbs, and Kilroot where Thurot
landed. 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> ruins of Abbey at Monks Town, where
tradition points out the grave of King Fergus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cushendun</span>, 10 m. from Glenarm.&mdash;A small village in
a romantic bay; grotesque caves, and a caverned rock on
which Red Castle stands: it presents several specimens of
whyn dykes to the geologist, containing veins of calcareous
spar mixed with coarse-grained basaltes. Between it and
Glenarm, about half way, rises the sharp promontory of
Garron Point, exhibiting a beautifully diversified trapose
outline, and projecting far into the sea, on a limestone
base wrought into caverns by the restless surge. A little
<span class="smcap">N.</span> of the point is the romantic vale of Glenariff, containing
red sandstone, porphyry intermixed with veins of jasper,
and a curious breccia or pudding-stone; but, to the sentimental
traveller it is even more interesting; for here he
may conceive himself in the genuine country of Ossian, as
nearly every romantic object in the vicinity bears a name
connected with that hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunluce Castle</span>, 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Bushmills.&mdash;The most
striking ruin on the coast; on an isolated, abrupt rock,
perforated by the waves which have formed under it
a very spacious cavern. The approach to it is along
a narrow wall; but it well repays the risk; its dark basaltic
walls marked with the mellow tints of time, in
some places forming a perpendicular line with the rock
on which it stands, whilst its commanding situation, its
numerous gables and turrets, (resembling the ruins of a village
destroyed by fire,) excite a high idea of its former magnificence,
and a feeling of regret for its lost splendour. It
was built probably by De Courcey, afterwards enlarged by
native chieftains, and finally by the Macdonnels in the time
of Elizabeth. Though in total ruin, a particular chamber is
said to be haunted, and to be the favourite abode of Mave
Roe, a Banshee or such fictitious personage, who sweeps it
every night; but, as Dr. Drummond observes, the sweeping
winds that rush through that and the other desolate
apartments, will sufficiently account for the cleanness of
the room without the aid of supernatural agency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairhead</span> or <span class="smcap">Benmore</span>, 4 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Ballycastle.&mdash;Is a
most interesting object, towering magnificently with its
massive columns of basaltes, forming a line of coast the
most fantastically beautiful that imagination can conceive.
It is strongly characterized by the savage wildness of its
cliffs, at whose foot the ocean rages with uncommon fury.
Scarce a single mark of vegetation has yet crept over the
hard rock to diversify its colour, but one uniform grayness
pervades its scenery, contrasting exquisitely with Bengore,
about 9 m. distant to the <span class="smcap">W.</span> The tourist must visit the
Fhirleath or Gray Man's Path, a deep chasm dividing the
solitary promontory in twain, with its solid walls of rude
and threatening columns upwards of 200 feet in perpendicular
abruptness.</p>

<p><a name="Ant" id="Ant"></a><span class="smcap">Giant's Causeway</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> from Ballycastle, and about
3 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Bushmills (the general station for tourists).&mdash;Is
an object not to be described in small limits, being a most
singular geological curiosity and one of Nature's most stupendous
productions. Dr. Drummond briefly states it to
consist of three moles, composed of basaltic columns projecting
into the sea from the middle of the semicircular
bay of Port Noffer; the longest of which, called the Grand
Causeway, extends in a sloping direction from the base of
the cliff about 300 feet, when it is lost in the ocean. The
pillars of which the Causeway consists have been estimated
at 30000; but that is too small a calculation. These are of
different dimensions; 15 to 36 feet in height, and from 15
to 26 inches in diameter, chiefly pentagonal or hexagonal;
each consists of joints or pieces concave and convex alternately
at the ends. The pillars are a species of basaltes
and kind of close grit, vitrifiable, of a dusky hue, contrasting
finally with the surrounding verdant scenery, and continued,
with interruptions, two miles along the precipitous
shore. On the eastern side the Giant's Loom, a colonnade of
36 feet in height; and on the opposite cliff may be seen the
Organ, so called from the resemblance to that instrument
in the group of columns: also the Giant's Well, Chair,
and Theatre, with the King and Parliament. Other objects
of curiosity are,&mdash;the large rounded masses of irregularly
prismatic basalt between the causeways, and the distinct
globular concretions at Port Coon, a little to the westward:
the curious whyn dyke at the head of the grand
causeway: the generally romantic scenery of Port Noffer:
then the cave of Port Coon, celebrated for its fine echo,
continually resounding to the dash of the waves: the Cave
of Dunkerry between Port Coon and the Bushfoot Strand,
accessible only from the ocean, between two mural ridges
of jet-black rock, with its lofty dome and sides overspread
with a covering of green <i>conferv&aelig;</i>, suggesting the idea that
it might have been scooped out of an emerald; a crimson
zone of marine plants, five or six feet in breadth, surrounds
and adorns it; and its extent has never yet been
ascertained, its sides contracting into a narrow cleft where
no boat can penetrate, but where the waves are heard rolling
to a considerable distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenarm</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Larne.&mdash;Castle of the Countess of
Antrim, still venerable and magnificent, and on the site
of an ancient Abbey: from the front is seen the Glen or
Great Park 13 m. in circuit; extremely romantic and beautiful;
consisting of wood and broken rock, with several
waterfalls and salmon-leaps formed by a large serpentine
river winding through the grounds, whilst its banks are
adorned with various evergreens; myrtles, and the <i>arbutus</i>
or strawberry-tree almost continually in blossom. From
the park are fine views of the sea; a distant prospect of
the Abbey in ruins, and the scenery considerably enriched
by the singular appearance of the adjacent mountains,
which are cultivated in corn to their very summits. In its
vicinity are many rude antiquities, supposed to be of Danish
origin.</p>

<p>See the <span class="smcap">Glens</span> on the borders of Red Bay, with the ruins
of Red Castle, 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Glenarm. The scenery around
is very romantic, the village being secluded in a glen,
where the limestone shores finely contrast with the azure
ocean. To the northward is the site of Dunmall, a fortress
where, tradition says, all the rent of Ireland was once
paid; but its only memorials are a mound and fosse with
the fragments of a wall. Beyond Garron Point see the curious
grotesque rock called Clough-i-stookin, of chalky
whiteness, bearing a striking resemblance to a female of
gigantic stature: near it the ruins of a Castle on a caverned
cliff, the echoes in which are curious: also Torr Point.
On the beach near Glynn the <i>Anomia Gryphus</i> and the <i>Vertebr&aelig;
pentacrinites</i> are found in abundance in a blue lime. To
the <span class="smcap">N.</span> of it stand the lofty and precipitous cliffs of Agnew's
Hill, said to be the loftiest hill in the county. The
vicinity of this romantic spot has been well described by
Mr. Wakefield, who, on descending the hill to Cushendall,
beholding on the one hand a cultivated mountain, and on
the other a vale of rich land in a high state of tillage, declares
that upon the whole a more extended and more delightful
prospect of hill and dale intermixed in charming variety,
is not often to be seen. He adds, that from Cushendall
to Glenarm, passing Red Bay and coasting along the
ocean, the whole way, the road exhibits the most romantic
and beautiful scenery. On the one hand magnificent and
widely extended views of the ocean, which on this coast
rolls its swelling waves towards the shore with a peculiar
and dangerous rapidity; and on the other, rocky mountains
of considerable height, whose hanging cliffs, as the road
extends partly up their sides, seem to threaten the traveller
with destruction; and which in some places are thickly
clothed with woods, through the openings between which
the eye is sometimes surprised with the sight of a village
as the road winds round the spacious bays and jutting promontories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lough Neagh</span> is the largest lake of fresh water in Europe,
with the exception of Ladoga, Onega, and Geneva,
being 20 m. by 12; and the country round it being level,
the furthest shores cannot be distinguished from any part
of its circumference; so that it resembles an ocean, particularly
in stormy weather, when the waves break suddenly
and are dangerous for boats. See Ram Island with its
Round Tower: inquire for Gems, Crystals, and Petrifactions.
The ride from Belfast, of about 16 m. is delightful;
and nothing can be finer than the view bursting on the
tourist from the top of Mount Devis, whether he contemplates
Lough Neagh, or turns round to admire the extensive
prospect over the County Down and Irish Channel, towards
the Isle of Man, and even the distant mountains of Wales.
Though this extensive inland sea receives no less than eight
rivers, yet the only outlet to the whole collected mass of
water is on the <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> extremity, at Toom, whence passing
through a small lake, Lough Beg, it forms the river Bann,
which runs into the sea at Coleraine. The great disproportion
between the outlet and the influx has given rise to
a conjecture of subterraneous passages; but not the smallest
indication of such a phenomenon has yet been
discovered,&mdash;so that the great means of reduction must be by
exhalation: to this it may be added, that in the dry season
the efflux is so trifling as to be waded at Toom, where it is
less than knee-deep; whilst on the other hand, in the wet
season, most of the rivers being mountainous, the influx is
so sudden and so greatly extensive, that 10,000 acres are
often covered, which were dry in summer. The geologist
may also notice the well-authenticated fact that, the Lough
often interrupts its own course to the sea, by the quantities
of sand and gravel which it deposits in the channel: all
those impediments are frequently accelerated, though sometimes
removed, by the casual direction and force of the
winds: hence the dilatation and contraction have not been
as yet reduced to any role; but the fact is certain that its
strongest tendency is towards expansion, its actual encroachments
being marked and known; for in one place it
has encompassed one Ch., (Ballyscullen) drowned great
part of the parish, and still seems gaining on the land. It
must be remembered that this Lough is perhaps the shallowest
piece of water in the world of such an extent, being
no where deeper than 11 fathoms. The trade carried on
upon the Lough has of late years received considerable additions
from three navigable canals; one of which leads to
Newry, where a river runs into the sea at Carlingford; the
second, through Lisburn, gains the sea at Belfast; and the
third takes a direction westerly, for inland purposes. In
stormy weather the waves break so short and dash with
such violence against the shoals at the foot of Shane's
Castle, that the spray is said often to have dashed into the
highest windows. In consequence of this, shipwrecks of the
craft are not unfrequent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pleaskin.</span>&mdash;A Cape a little to the <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Giant's Causeway;
the most striking of all the semicircular precipices on
this range of coast, in the opinion of Dr. Drummond and
the ingenious but unfortunate Dr. Hamilton. In the sixteen
different strata of which it is composed, beauty and sublimity
are wonderfully blended and harmonised. Over a dark
and rugged base fringed with incessant foam it lifts its
sides adorned with various tints of green gray lichen, and
vermilion rock, with a rapid declivity to about half its elevation,
and thence becomes perpendicular. On a stratum
of red ochre at the elevation of 200 feet, stands a magnificent
gallery of basaltic columns, 44 feet in height, with
others equally romantic; like a theatre of Nature harmoniously
arranged, rock upon rock, gallery upon gallery, so
magnificent, so solitary, and facing the wide Atlantic, as if
formed for the temple of "spirits from the vasty deep!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larne</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from Carrickfergus,&mdash;worth notice for

<h2><a name="ARMAGH" id="ARMAGH">ARMAGH</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is an inland county; the northern part bordering on Lough
Neagh, consists of most extensive bogs of extraordinary
depth and a remarkably black soil, and thereby affords no
scenery worth attention. But in the immediate vicinity of
the city of Armagh, the tourist is gratified by a richer prospect,
where an abundant population finds employment in
well inclosed and well cultivated fields. To the southward
the appearance deteriorates, especially in that part called
the Fews; a district of dark black mountains, where the
hand of industry or the eye of taste has scarcely yet penetrated.
Yet it is well worthy the notice of the picturesque
tourist, from its alpine views, particularly round Slieve
Gullien, which rivals the loftiest in England or Wales. In
the vicinity of Armagh the soil is fertile, consisting generally
of a rich brown loam with limestone and limestone
gravel, and the appearance of the gently undulating grounds
has been compared to eggs set in salt: bounded on the
<span class="smcap">S.W.</span> by Monaghan; <span class="smcap">W.</span> by Tyrone; <span class="smcap">N.</span> by Lough Neagh; <span class="smcap">E.</span>
by Down; <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> by Louth. The two principal lakes are Carlough
and Lough Clay.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Armagh</span>, 62 m. from Dublin, the metropolitan see of all
Ireland,&mdash;stands on the acclivity of a lofty mountain, the
top occupied by the Cathedral which forms a fine object.
The place is considerable; the new streets handsome.
Archbishop's Palace adjoining the town, a modern edifice
of unadorned simplicity: barracks large, airy, and even
elegant: see the College; commodious Charter School:
New Ch. of white stone with handsome spire: Public Infirmary,
Public Library, and Observatory: curious market
Cross. Examine improvements of the late Archbishop,
aided by the judicious exertions of the present Primate.
About 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> is Clonfeckle, on the borders of Tyrone,
deserving the notice of the agricultural tourist as
the residence and farm of Dr. Richardson, the cultivator
of Fiorin grass. (<i>Curwen's Letters</i>, vol. ii. p. 319.) Also
Lisnadell, 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Armagh: handsome Ch. and Glebe
House, erected by the patriotic Archbishop Robinson.
About 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> is Newton Hamilton, stated in tradition as
the scene of a sanguinary battle between the great O'Neil
and a chieftain of Louth, in consequence of the latter singeing
the beard of his guest at a banquet, and in which
O'Neil lost his life. See also near to it remains of an old
Cromwellian encampment: and ruins of Black Bank Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlemont</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Armagh.&mdash;A good town and
military dep&ocirc;t. See the fort and barracks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonesborough</span>, a small village, but a good station for
the visitant of the wild mountain scenery in its vicinity, particularly
Slieve Gullien. Rocks, caverns, glyns, from a
bold ascent, are the features of the summit of this mountain,
without the smallest appearance of any calcareous
matter; and although there have not hitherto, says Sir
C. Coote, been any minerals discovered here, yet there
is a strong probability of their existence from the metallic
tinge of the waters which burst from its sides, oozing in
plentiful discharges even in the driest seasons. On its
summit is a cairn of stones which form the roof of a cavern
that at first view appears to be natural, but on minute
investigation has evident testimony of being the work
of art. The apartment is difficult of entrance, but is large
within; and as there is a flagged way to the edge of the
lake at the foot, it seems intended for other than sepulchral
purposes. Sir C. Coote observes, that perhaps a
bolder prospect is not presented by any mountain in Ireland
than from its summit, comprising a great extent of
country; the lakes and streams, the several towns and
well-cultivated demesnes, together with the bay of Dundalk,
where the declivity is terminated; these, with a
thousand other natural beauties which are presented to
view, will repay the fatigue of the ascent, and an awful
and impressive pleasure is afforded in contemplating the
bold promontories and rugged cliffs bared by the tempests,
and arresting the floating meteors, throughout furnishing
ample resources for the inquisitive philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lurgan</span>, about 14 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> from Armagh.&mdash;A large town,
principally of one extensive and neatly kept street; surrounded
by the linen manufacture, Ch. and Spire. See the
house and handsome grounds of the Brownlow family, with
good views of Lough Neagh. The mansion, an antique
Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Markethill</span>, a thriving town about 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> from
Armagh, with good Inn.&mdash;In the Fews a wild, barren,
but romantic district, the admirers of Dean Swift will be
gratified in tracing many spots noticed by that eccentric
character; especially Hamilton's Bawn, Gosford Castle,
and Draper's Hill, about 1 m. distant. Throughout these
wild and romantic mountains there is something very interesting,
awful, and grateful, to the lover of nature, elevating
the inquisitive mind, and inspiring a strong desire
to explore their inmost recesses, and a desire to become
familiar with so sublime a solitude. (<i>See further, Sir C.
Coote's Survey of County</i>, p. 35.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portadown</span>, 3 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Lurgan,&mdash;is a neat town on the
Bann, at the junction of the Newry canal with that river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rich Hill</span>, about 4 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> from Armagh,&mdash;is a small
village, but deserves notice for the beautiful residence of
Sir Capel Molyneux at Castle Dillon, with extensive plantations,
lakes, &amp;c. and two handsome columns in honour of
St. Patrick and the volunteers of Ireland. The appearance
of the village itself is interesting, and considerably improved
by the elegant demesne of Mr. Richardson, in full
view of the street, with antique Castle. Proceed through
a charmingly wooded country towards the Church of Kilmore,
and thence by good roads to Loughgall village,
where is Drummilly, an ancient mansion with extensive
plantations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tanderagee</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Armagh,&mdash;affords good specimens
of the linen manufacture. Acton village, 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, the

at Points Pass; and near to it is Scarvagh Pass on the
borders of Down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tynan</span>, about 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Armagh,&mdash;stands pleasantly
on an eminence near a river of the same name. See excellent
Ch. and lofty steeple: also in the Church-yard an oblong
stone of about 18 inches square and 4 feet long, set
upon a large block stone, and capped with another, divided
into square compartments, and having vestiges of sculpture.

<h2><a name="CARLOW" id="CARLOW">CARLOW</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is a small county; interesting to the picturesque tourist
from the variety, if not from the sublimity of its scenery;
but even in that he may be gratified whilst rambling amidst
the mountainous chain from Mount Leinster to Blackstairs
on the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, a district awfully grand and majestic, and the
range impassable except at Scullogh Gap, resembling the
Ghauts or passes in the mountains of India. In the western
part of the county also, on the banks of the Barrow, the
rugged mountainous range is beautifully fringed with timber,
even to the summits of some of its loftiest hills, agreeably
chequered by cultivation, and studded with the mansions
of opulence, whose snow-white chimneys peeping
through the foliage give earnest of the national hospitality
that reigns amongst them. Indeed all writers agree,
that some of the most beautiful and picturesque scenery in
Ireland is to be met with in this division of the county and
around the town of Carlow. It is a curious remark of Mr.
Wakefield respecting this county, that it has neither a temporal
nor spiritual peer resident within it; and yet, though
destitute of manufactures, it is tenanted by more wealthy
people than almost any other county in the island. It is
worthy of remark also, that the fee has been transferred
more here than in any other part of the country, and that
a great part of it belonged formerly to Quakers. Bounded

manufactures: some slight remains of its ancient Castle,
which recently fell, a mere heap of ruins: the venerable
old Ch., from the vicinity of which is a very extensive view,
commanding a fertile and well wooded country enlivened
by the majestic windings of the river Barrow: ruins of the
very fine Abbey founded before the English conquest: the
Roman Catholic College, an extensive building, with good
gardens and a park for the students' recreation, with the
Gaol, Barracks, &amp;c. Miss Plumptre says, that "Carlow
is superior to most towns in the kingdom in the neatness
of its appearance:" and Hall says that "the ground about
it is better improved than in many parts of England." The
town and immediate vicinity present some historical recollections;
and though the English tourist may not be much
interested in the disputes of the Earls of Kildare and Thomond,
and the predatory exploits of O'More; yet events of
a later date, connected with its siege by Ireton in the civil
wars, may lead to inquiry and investigation. It was also the
scene of a sanguinary battle, though on a small scale, in the
year 1798, being assaulted by the rebels before day-break,
and successfully defended by a small party of military and
the loyal yeomanry. The visitor will not omit the pleasing
domain of Mr. Cavanagh, in the immediate vicinity, from
whence the Blackstairs mountains form a striking object;
though not lofty, yet bold, bleak, and rugged. Mr. Curwen
speaks highly of the scenery in the vale between Carlow
and Leighlin Bridge, with enchanting and extensive
prospects over a rich country of the most sublime and picturesque
features. This valley is about six miles in breadth,
bounded on each side by a chain of mountains finely wooded,
well inclosed, and cultivated to their summits. Villages
and gentlemen's seats to be seen on all sides, with whitewashed
cottages well sheltered by trees, and presenting a
pleasing air of rural comfort and industry. See Ardglass,
4 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, a high green hill, from whence there is a most enchanting
prospect of the county, and also Kildare. On its
summit is an ancient Catholic Chapel, built in form of a
cross, but much resembling a dilapidated barn: read some
justly-flattering epitaphs to the Grace family, not badly
written. At Kellystown, on the east bank of the Barrow,
extensive ruins of a Ch. said to have been first erected by
St. Patrick. At Staplestown 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> a pleasing mansion
of Mr. Bagnall, once intended to rival Versailles, the
grounds owing much both to nature and art, and watered
by the romantic little river Burrin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leighlin Bridge</span>,&mdash;is a small village about 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of
Carlow, with remains of an ancient Castle and some monastic
ruins, which have also been castellated. The view
from the bridge with the Black Castle at one end is very
fine, though the bridge itself is more venerable than picturesque;
built in 1320, by a liberal canon of Kildare. The
course of the river Barrow presents views of great fertility
and beauty, though certainly not so romantic as many smaller
streams. See Bally Ellen Castle in ruins about 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>;
also Ballylaghan Castle, which presents a gateway between
two lofty circular towers, in the style of Tunbridge Castle.
Though the castle stands low, yet the view to the westward
is very fine; and, as its walls are in pretty good preservation,
it affords an amusing object of research to the antiquary,
who may ascend some ruinous staircases into several
of the apartments, and gratify his fancy by the recollection
of past times. Ballymorn Castle, 5 m. distant, is an
extensive ruin standing in a deep vale surrounded by lofty
mountains. It is of the middle ages, but has Gothic windows
in the interior, and has the peculiarity of its outer
walls being perforated by a gallery from whence the garrison
could discharge their missiles through numerous loop-holes.
Only one large tower remains. Clonmore is an extensive
and pleasing ruin, presenting a good idea of the arrangements,
half military half domestic, of the earlier times,
though unroofed and much dilapidated, but rendered venerable
by the covering of thick ivy that mantles its walls, affording
shelter to the birds of night. Fenough, 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>,
has an old Castle near the church, once a residence of the
kings of Leinster. Garryhaddon, 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, a deserted mansion
of the Ormond family, has an appearance of ancient
magnificence, with an extensive park and gardens. Whilst
the picturesque tourist is rambling through the Carlow
mountains, he will not omit visiting a deep recess in the
Slieumargah, where stand the remains of the Abbey of
Old Leighlin, recorded in the earliest monastic legends,
but now exhibiting no remnants of architecture anterior
to the 12th century, when it was re-edified, after
destruction by fire about the time of the Norman conquest.
Here was once a celebrated episcopal city; but
the ruins of the Abbey, of which the cathedral is still kept
in decent repair as a parish Ch., alone remain. The Abbey,
though not very extensive, is deserving of notice
on account of its pinnacled spire and the rich tracery of
its Gothic windows, being about the time of Hen. II. or at
least re-edified after a destructive fire; but suffered to
sink into ruin since the union of the Sees of Leighlin and
Ferns. On the west side of the Ch. under some trees, see
the once celebrated well of St. Laferian, now nearly filled
up, and near it a rude stone cross. The antiquary will also
find subjects of research in some old termini or stones of
memorial erected by Bishop Harlewin about 1216, as boundaries
of the liberties of the ancient city; one of these is
close by Leighlin Bridge, another near Wells, and a third
on the mountains. Ledwich gives a good engraving in his
<i>Antiquities</i>. The antiquary will derive some pleasure from
a visit to a small village, St. Mullins, about 15 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> from
Leighlin Bridge and agreeably seated on the Barrow. This
place, particularly its extensive burial-ground, possesses
much sanctity in the opinions of the lower Irish, from its
antiquity, having been founded as early as the 7th century
by a saint of the name, who built the church here and was
bishop of Ferns. This episcopal eremite long inhabited the
gloomy vale of Glendaloch, was a great patriot, causing the
remission of a tax of oxen, and a great prophet also. The
ruins, though not very extensive, are picturesque, and the
whole scene one of solemn meditation, backed by the lofty
mountains of Blackstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tullow</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Carlow.&mdash;A pleasant town on the
Slaney. Bridge of six arches: close to it ruins of an Abbey:
Castle converted into barracks: neat Ch. and Market-house:&mdash;taken
by Cromwell after a sanguinary siege.
Hackets Town, about 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, a small neat village, the
scene of two violent assaults by the rebels in 1798. Mount
Leinster, about 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, deserves the sportsman's notice, for
its hares, foxes, and grouse; also a well said to be unfathomable,

<p><span class="smcap">Cavan</span>, though an inland district, possesses more water
scenery and more diversified than any other in the island,
with the exception of Kerry; for here the tourist meets
with many beautiful and picturesque landscapes enlivened
by small lakes, in some places spreading into expanse, in
others assuming the form of rivers, proceeding from the
lakes of Westmeath in their course to Lough Erne. The
general face of the county consists of eminences, which,
though not very lofty, yet rugged and uneven, afford a great
variety of prospect, and swell into mountains on the borders
of Fermanagh and Leitrim. This county came very late
into civilization or even cultivation, being one of the
most celebrated in the ancient feuds and wars for its fastnesses,
woods, bogs, and all the natural impediments so
formidable in warfare. It is exactly midway between the
Atlantic Ocean and St. George's Channel; but its extremes
are not more than 14 m. distant from the sea:&mdash;the tourist
will find the roads rather indifferent. Bounded on the <span class="smcap">N.</span>
by Fermanagh and Monaghan, <span class="smcap">E.</span> by Westmeath, <span class="smcap">S.</span> by
Longford, <span class="smcap">W.</span> by Leitrim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Belturbet</span>, about 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Cavan; built upon an
eminence above the river Erne, on which there is much romantic
scenery.&mdash;See the Tower and Market-house, and
some vestiges of an ancient fortification beyond the church.
Ballyconnel, 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, is a good station for head-quarters in
viewing this end of Lough Erne. Examine Ortnacullagh
mountain for minerals and spars. Ballyhayes, though only
a common village, possesses some antique and fantastical
buildings that show it to have once been a place of considerable
note. The Mansion-house is a curious specimen
of Irish feudal splendour. Near it the poor but
enchantingly situated village of Butler's Bridge. Drumlane
Priory, 3 m. from Belturbet, is now little more
than a large barn used as a church, but of considerable antiquity,
being founded as early as the 6th century; though
it is probable that the oldest part now remaining is the
round tower which stands close to one corner of the sacred
edifice. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and long of
great sanctity as a place of sepulture; but perhaps more
remarkable in its being the birth-place of St. Maidoc, a celebrated
legendary personage, respecting whose parents
these holy legends are wisely silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cavan</span>, 54 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Dublin.&mdash;Sir Rich. C. Hoare
describes it as situated in a vale near a small river, and
making but a poor appearance as a county town. See the
Court-house and Barracks. Ballyhedy Bridge, about 3 m.
distant, crosses the Erne, in a pleasing country surrounded
by beautiful mansions and highly improved demesnes. Near
it see Farnham, the mansion of Earl Farnham, which
Wakefield considers as one of the finest and best kept demesnes
in the island. It affords abundance of views intermixed
with some lake scenery; and the cottage at Killishandra
not far distant, together with one called Lady
Farnham's, an elegant retreat on the border of a small
lake, are well worth seeing. At the latter in particular,
the scenery is exceedingly romantic, the sides of the hills
being covered with waving trees approaching close to the
level of the water. Notice the pleasing views on the river
Croghan; also the neat Ch. with the ruins of an old Castle
on the western bank: also the richly wooded demesne of
Castle Sanderson, with the spacious lake and grounds of
Cloverhill, and the new mansion of Castle Hamilton. Visit
the mountain of Bruce Hill. Kilmore, 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, is remarkable
for the smallest Cathedral in the empire, being nothing
but the parish church: near it is Lough Outer, where
stand the ruins of an ancient Castle on a small island, remarkable
as the prison of the good Bishop Bedell, during
the rebellion of 1641. Sir C. Coote observes (in his Survey
of the County), that the many beautiful islands encircled by
this charming lake are crowned with the finest timber,
which their undulating surface presents to view in a variety
of shades; and their deep recesses and romantic scenery
strongly picture to the mind the aptitude of these sequestered
islands for the superstitious rites which formerly were
celebrated there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cootehill</span>, about 9 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cavan,&mdash;is a smart well-built
town, and shows the advantages resulting from the
introduction of the linen manufacture. It contains nothing
very remarkable; but is a good station for several objects
in its vicinity. Baillieborough is 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, close to which is
a pleasant lough; also a chalybeate spring. The view from
the Ch. is good; and on the summit of a hill, between it
and King's Court, is a pool long celebrated for its antiscorbutic
qualities, the patients bathing in it and rubbing their
bodies with the mud. It well deserves the notice of the
geologist and the medical tourist. Bellamont Forest, the
family seat of the Bellamonts, uniting with Dawson's Grove,
forms a tract of romantic scenery that must not be neglected
by the picturesque traveller. The views from it are very
fine; and Bruce Hill is a most striking feature in the scenery.
King's Court is a modern creation, rising fast into a
thriving town, clearly exemplifying what may be done by a
patriotic landlord. In its vicinity are several deep glens
and valleys, within which flow rapid streams affording many
romantic and interesting scenes. See ruins of Castle at
Muff. Shircock, about 7 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, has some lakes in its neighbourhood.
About 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> visit a narrow glen, in which the
mineralogist will find much amusement. Specimens of
coal and other fossils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dalys Bridge</span>, about 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> from Cavan,&mdash;is a neat
village, with several pleasing objects in its vicinity. Shaalan
Lake, or Lough Shecklin, deserves a visit, being 7 m.
long and 4 broad in some places; studded on the north side
with gentlemen's cottages used as sporting-boxes, and extremely
well planted: whilst on its southern verge, amidst
lofty hills and fertile cornfields, may be seen the ruins of
the ancient Castle of Ross, with the high hill or Ben of
Fore. On an island are the ruins of an Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swadlinbar</span>, a neat village about 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Cavan,&mdash;has
long been celebrated for its Spa, containing sulphur,
earth, sea salt, and fossil alkali, being alterative and
diaphoretic. Near it are the ruins of a Ch.; and a little
further, but in Fermanagh, is the splendid mansion of Florence
Court, a seat of the <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Enniskillin. See and examine
Quilca mountain, with its iron mines, and a spring of good
water on its summit: its general appearance is very grand,
overhanging the valley in towering magnificence. The tourist
will here be amused with many legendary tales of feudal
times, of sprites and fa&euml;ry. Its summit was the ancient
place of investiture for the MacGwyres, once the petty
kings of this district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Cavan,&mdash;is a small village, and
in the immediate vicinity of Lough Ramor, of great extent,
studded with islands once clothed with foliage but now denuded,
yet still possessing the ruins of several old Castles.</p></blockquote>

on account of the apparent comfort of the lower classes;
the town itself neat and thriving. See the neat modern
Ch. surmounted by the ruins of the venerable Abbey, one
of the finest in Ireland, whose long narrow windows, divided
by stone railing, with the remnants of some delicate
carving and other architectural ornaments, are considered
by Grose as speaking its era, and the expense bestowed
upon it in the 13th century. See also the handsome Charity

antiquary may examine the tombstone, with the Ogham
inscription on Conan the Swift-footed, whose death and
burial-place are recorded in an historical tale supposed to
have been written by Ossian in the year 296. See also the
Druidical altar on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of the mountain. Between

the romantic district of Burrin. See the ancient Cathedral,
with its numerous sanctified and heraldic ornaments: statue
of St. Fechnan the founder, in the choir; seven crosses
of a single stone each, with antique sculpture. Corcomroe
Abbey, a few miles to the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, was the scene of many feudal
battles between the O'Connors and O'Briens, of which
there are some monuments. Near it is Ennistymond, a pleasant
village, several Castles in ruins, particularly Inchiquin
and Moyvore. The tourist must not omit the extensive and
astonishing prospect from Hagshead, 1300 feet above the

of rock. A bridge of 18 arches leads to the town, after which
the ascent is steep; but the Cathedral stands at the bottom
close to the river, and lately fitted up in a modern style.
The southern portal, North Chapel, is a most curious and
well sculptured specimen of rich Gothic architecture, of a
grotesque and irregular design, and, though evidently a
doorway, has been considered by some persons as a monument.
The font has some curious arabesque ornaments.
See the Oratory, a curious specimen of the religious architecture
of the Ostmen in the 9th century, and one of the
oldest structures of wood and stone in the island. Its rude
walls are not very high, but the gables are pyramidal and

the patron saint, St. Molva. See the Salmon Fishery and
Eel Weir. Whilst in this vicinity, visit Lough Derg, and
notice the bay of Skariff with a wooded peninsula, and
island of 20 acres called Holy Island, on which are a round

The country round not very picturesque, but improving
in cultivation, with many genteel residences: yet if the
traveller in his route from Killaloe to Limerick takes the
road by Castle Connel, which however is rather a detour,
he will be amply gratified by the interesting scenery. In the

by the Ch., and venerable ruin of an ancient Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bantry</span>, about 35 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Cork,&mdash;is situated on one
of the finest bays in the world, and was noted by the defeat
of the French squadron in 1796. The scenery amidst
the mountains in which this town is embosomed, Mr. Wakefield
thinks scarcely, if at all, exceeded by any other in the
island, with the exception of Killarney. The views in all
directions are bold, wild, and romantic; especially towards
the head of the bay, which is mountainous, and abounding
with scenes as rude and wild as imagination can paint or
fancy anticipate. Miss Plumptre also describes it as highly
worthy the notice of the picturesque tourist; and Mr.
Wakefield observes, that the ride to Coolranny Bridge he
thinks one of the most delightful that can be conceived.
The ascent from that place to the Gowl mountains is very
fine, from the gap of which the whole bay appears in its
full extent, with lofty mountains on the opposite shore,
and Cape Clear in the distant prospect rising above them
all. Near this is Hungray Hill, 700 yards above the bay,
being 20 miles from Bantry, but amply repaying by the
most extensive prospect from its summit, whilst the falls
of water down its sides in the winter season are extremely
grand. But the greatest charm in the vicinity of Bantry is
Glengariff, the road to which runs through some fine mountain
scenery, and near it is the modern mansion of Mr. White,
surrounded by extensive woods and standing on the edge
of one of the finest indentations of the bay, perfect in its
form and embosomed at the foot of lofty mountains: much
of the surrounding beauty arises from the luxuriant foliage
of arbutus, holly, and birch; whilst every turn opens a new
glen, everywhere presenting varied and enchanting scenery,
beautifully contrasted by the wildness of the opposite
mountains. It is not a trifling addition to the amenity of this
spot, that the mildness of the winter only strips the deciduous
trees of their leaves for a very short time, whilst geraniums
and myrtles, and many of the tenderest plants actually
remain unsheltered during the whole year. Dursey Island in
the bay has the ruins of a Castle. The Priest's Leap is a
mountainous pass leading over Mangerton towards Killarney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Lyons</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cork.&mdash;A well built town
in an agreeable vale on the banks of the Bride river. See
Lord Barrymore's mansion erected on the ruins of O'Lehan's
Castle; also ruins of a Franciscan Abbey, 1307.
Near it Kilrea Castle in ruins, to the <span class="smcap">E.</span> of which the venerable
remains of an Abbey dedicated to St. Bridgid, about
1450, with ancient tombs and numerous awful indications
of mortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castlemartyr</span>, 16 m. from Cork, a large manufacturing
town.&mdash;See the ruins of the ancient Castle, and the
seat and grounds of the Boyle family: the house itself is
worth seeing, being antique and assimilating well with the
richly clad wild remains of an ancient castle, whose venerable
turrets in majestic ruin peep forth from the thick foliage
at a short distance; add to this an extensive sheet of
water, which gives life to the surrounding scenery. Let the
botanical tourist pay particular attention to the flower-garden
and green-houses, elegantly arranged under the taste
and genius of the Countess of Shannon. Visit Ballycotton
Bay, with extensive strand, good wild fowl shooting and
excellent flat- and shell-fish. See there the Ch. and Castle
of Ballycrenane. About 1 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> is the river Dour, which
breaks out from a limestone rock, after a subterraneous
course of near half a mile, and forms a small lake, where the
Halcyon or Kingsfisher is found in great numbers: Charleville,
14 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Cork, on the borders of Limerick; see
Charter School, Ch. and Barracks. The magnificent seat
of the Earls of Orrery was burnt down in the wars of the
Revolution by the Duke of Berwick after dinner, like the
ancient Persepolis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloghnakilty</span>, 22 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Cork,&mdash;is seated on a shoal
and dangerous bay. See the plain neat Ch. pleasingly situated,
but the town is described by Miss Plumptre as poor
and dirty. Dundedy or Galway Head has some curious
caves worn out by the sea, also ruins of an old Castle. Iniskean,
about 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, has close to it the ruins of Kinigh
Ch. with remarkable round tower, a hexagon at the bottom
and the upper part round, 70 feet high and 124 feet from
the Ch. At Temple Bryan, 1 m. distant, are some remains
of an ancient Temple; near the Ch. a stone circle with
central pyramidal pillar, and two other pyramids in the immediate
vicinity. At Timoleague, about 5 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, see ruins
of O'Shaughnessy's Castle, and the extensive remains of a
venerable Franciscan Abbey, 1350, with numerous tombs
of Irish chieftains, Gothic cloisters, and romantic ruins of
the ancient monastic apartments: see also the Holy Well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cloyne</span>, about 16 m. from Cork.&mdash;See the Cathedral;
the Bishop's Palace; a small Castle of the Fitzgeralds; a
round tower near the Ch.; a Danish rath, and a deep extensive
cave in a park near the town. 1 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> at Castle
Mary, the seat of Lord Longueville, see the Druids' altar,
a large stone 15 feet in length, 8 in breadth, and 9 feet from
the ground. In the vicinity the mineralogist will find a
white substance tinged with yellow ochre, which does not
effervesce with acids, but forms a good white paint if mixed
with linseed oil. Here also are quarries of fine gray marble.
2 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> is Rostellan, the seat of the Marquis of Thomond,
with a fine view of Cork harbour, and built on the
ruins of an ancient Castle. To the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> see Corkbeg, a modern
seat with some ecclesiastical ruins near it. The tourist
may also proceed to the strand of Ballycroneen to visit an
ancient pillar on a hill; also Lascally, a strong moted
Danish encampment; Bally Kendrick Castle, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cork</span>, the second city of Ireland, is 124 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dublin.&mdash;Sir
Rich. C. Hoare describes it as affording more interest
to the commercial than the antiquarian tourist; and
Miss Plumptre observes that it is upon the whole recommendable
to the eye only as having a general appearance
of comfort and prosperity, not as offering any particular subjects
to dwell upon. Mr. Curwen indeed views it with a
more favourable notice, and finds many things to approve.
Seated on the river Lea, the old town rising on a hill forms
an amphitheatre; in the new town some of the streets are
spacious, well-built, and handsome. See the Cathedral
partly modernized; the Parade, a spacious street with
equestrian statue of Geo. II.; the Exchange; Custom
House; Botanic Garden belonging to the Literary Institution;
Barracks; extensive Porter Brewery; manufactories
of Paper, Glass, and Cloth; Market House, &amp;c. The environs
are thickly studded with mercantile villas, and present
views of happy amelioration. See at Ballyvacadane, 4 m. from
Cork, a ruined Abbey; and Ballincolly Castle built upon a
rock. Barrymore Island in the bay deserves the notice of the
geologist from the circumstance of having a stratum of limestone
running through it, although nothing but a red gritty
stone exists upon the main land in its vicinity. Blarney
Castle, 3 m. distant, must not be forgotten by the tourist.
It stands on a bold romantic rock, its walls 18 feet thick,
and bore a long siege at the Revolution, but was taken by
King William's troops. Part only of the ancient Castle remains,
but with modern additions. Those who please may
kiss the well-known stone on the summit of the tower, and
acquire a perpetual license for flattery and fiction. Carigrohan
Castle to the <span class="smcap">w.</span> has still some remains on a high precipice
over the river. The tourist may visit Cove, and the
Giant's Stairs, a curious natural production. The marine
views in an aquatic excursion to Cork Harbour are very fine;
the whole of it is indeed surrounded by stations which command
the most beautiful and diversified prospects. If approaching
it direct from the sea, the grand panorama which
opens to the view in sailing up the narrow entrance, has a
most striking effect: on the right Cork Beg, a seat of the
Fitzgeralds, with some Abbey ruins; beyond it the woods
of Rostellan, the seat of the Marquis of Thomond; then
Haulbowling Island, and the lofty hills to the left, forming
altogether a grand and impressive scene. Glanmire, 5 m.
distant, is a beautiful glen on a narrow arm of the sea, with
neat village and Ch. and good view of the harbour. At
Monkstown see the fine old Castle on a wooded eminence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doneraile</span>, about 16 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Cork,&mdash;has a neat Ch. with
lofty spire; see the Barracks on ruins of the old Castle;
also some quarries of variegated marble near to it. See
ruins of Castletown Roche, gallantly defended by Lady
Roche against Cromwell's forces; also Carrigrocunny Castle
and romantic ruins of an ancient Abbey at Bridgetown.
Castle Saffron, 1 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, has several agreeable cascades on
the river. Kilcoleman Castle in ruins, 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, will always
be interesting to the lover of ancient British poetry,
as the spot where Spenser wrote his Fa&euml;ry Queen. The
scenery is magnificent, and the prospect extensive. Monanimy,
about 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, has the ruins of an old Castle and Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fermoy</span>, a newly built elegant town of four streets
crossing each other at right angles, the work of a Scotch
gentleman, Mr. Anderson, is about 15 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cork;
with a bridge of 13 arches mantled with ivy. See the extensive
barracks; modern Ch.; ruins of ancient Castles
in its vicinity. See Ballyhooly, a picturesque village; also
Castle Hyde, a seat well wooded; and ruins of Creg Castle.
Miss Plumptre and Mr. Curwen speak highly of the patriotic
improvements in this town and vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinsale</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Cork,&mdash;has a spacious harbour, and
has been noted from the earliest times in Irish history. It
was taken by the Spaniards in 1600, and stood a siege by
the Duke of Marlborough in James's wars. See some remains
of ruined Abbeys in the town: visit also Charles Fort,
1 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> in 1670. The picturesque tourist may visit the
Old Head, 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, with Light-house, and ruins of Duncearma
Castle, the old seat of Irish kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilworth</span>, a thriving town about 20 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cork,&mdash;has
some good mountain scenery in its vicinity. Near it
is Moorfield, the superb residence of Lord Mount Cashel,
also ruins of Cloughleagh Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macroom</span>, about 16 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Cork.&mdash;See ancient Castle
built by King John, still inhabited; also the handsome
Ch. In the river Sillane the sportsman will find good trout-fishing.
At Agh-a-bollogue, see old Ch. and Holy Well, with
the stone called St. Olan's Cap, about which are many superstitious
and legendary tales. At Ballyvourney, 6 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>,
see ruins of Ch. with stone Cross and Holy Well. At Carig-a-drohid,
3 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, ruins of Castle on steep romantic rocks;
and at Carrigafouky, 2 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, ancient ruins of MacCarty's
Castle on a wild craggy precipice, with remains of a Druidical
altar. Dunda Rock, 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, has a lofty Castle commanding
a most extensive prospect. Glyncaum, or the
crooked Glyn, is a deep hollow way between steep craggy
rocky walls covered with forest trees and shrubby foliage,
to the <span class="smcap">S.</span> of which see ruins of Magshanagloss Castle. Gougenabera,
5 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, on the road from Cork to Killarney, presents
most romantic scenery round the wild solitude of its
secluded lake. Near it is Inchigeela, which offers considerable
amusement to the mineralogist. At Lesecresig, on
the summit of a hill 2 m. from Macroom, see an ancient
cairn with Druidical altar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mallow</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Cork, has long been celebrated as
a watering-place. See ruins of an old Castle, Ch., and Barracks;
also bridge over the Blackwater, and ruins of an
ancient Castle in the well wooded Jephson demesne. Sir R.
C. Hoare details some curious traditions respecting it. Also
Ballyellis, handsome seat of the Hare family. At Ballynamona,
3 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> (so famed in Irish melodies), are ruins of
Mourne Abbey. Buttevant, a few miles distant, will amply
repay the antiquary for a visit, by the remains of its
venerable Abbey; ruins of ancient towers and other picturesque
scenery: near to it see Ballybeg, where are ruins of
an ancient monastery of Augustines. Dromagh, about
10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, has an old Castle of the O'Keefes, with ruins
of a Nunnery: and at Kanturk, 3 m. distant, are several
remnants of castellated antiquity. Liscarrol, about 5 m.
<span class="smcap">W.</span> of Buttevant, has an ancient Castle in ruins, and was
the scene of sanguinary battles in the civil wars. See deep
hole, supposed to be fathomless, called Kateshole. Lohort
Castle is an old Elizabethan mansion of Lord Arden, fortified
in the ancient style with a moat, having a fine terrace
on its roof and surrounded with pleasing plantations. Newmarket
in the vicinity has some good mountain scenery;
and the tourist may visit Woodfort, a handsome seat, with
a turret on a hill, from whence a most enchanting prospect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mitchelstown</span>, a neat little town, 21 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cork.&mdash;See
the magnificent seat of Lord Kingston, and the College,
a liberal charity. See in the vicinity, at Brigowne,
1 m., ruins of Ch. and round tower: 1&frac12; m., ruins of Caherdriny
Castle; 2 m., ruins of Carriganoura Castle.
Castle Hyde near to Mitchelstown deserves a visit. The
grounds are extensive, and the house is curiously seated
at the base of a lofty rock. The park contains much
diversified scenery, and is traversed by the romantic Blackwater.
See the marble quarries, esteemed as handsome as
any in Ireland; of a dark gray colour with various shades,
and a rich display of shells. At Skehewrinky, see the cave
in a limestone hill of dangerous descent, but beautifully
encrusted with spar and resembling a vaulted cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Middleton</span>, half way between Cork and Youghall, at
the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> corner of Cork harbour. See some ancient ruins
of a Castle and Abbey; the Market-house; public Freeschool,
an elegant building; some remains of Danish works
and a large rath at Ballinachora. Several of the curiosities
are noticed under <span class="smcap">Cloyne</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mill Street</span>, 20 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> is a small village, with some
appearance of the linen manufacture. The roads are bad; but
it has near it a continued range of mountains that deserve
investigation, particularly two amongst them called the
Papps, from their singular resemblance to the human breast,
and having two little protuberances on the very summit of
each, which enforce the resemblance more strongly: these
Sir R. C. Hoare suspects to be carnedds or Tumuli. Near
it see ruins of Clodagh Castle, feudal seat of the Mac
Swinneys, once distinguished for its hospitality by an inscription
inviting all strangers to enter; at Clondrohid, ancient
Ch. and Danish encampments; and 1 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, on Lessecresighill,
vestiges of a Druidical altar. At Kilnamartery,
curious white rocks, at a distance resembling the
ruins of a magnificent city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rathcormuck</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Cork, a decent town, with Ch.
and neat Market-house. See to the <span class="smcap">N.</span> Cairn Tierna, a range
of mountains with an ancient cairn, forming a conspicuous
object. Glanmire is described by Miss Plumptre as a village
in a beautiful and romantic situation:&mdash;trace the rivulet
through the deep and picturesque glen. Glanworth has
spacious ruins of an ancient Castle, and some remains of a
Dominican Abbey, with good river scenery. 1 m. distant
is a most curious sepulchral monument called Labacally or
the Hag's Bed, said by tradition to have belonged to a giantess
of whom many ridiculous fables are related. Its real
history and antiquity are unknown: it consists of several
broad flag-stones supported by others, and most of
them of an enormous size, one no less than 17 feet long
and 9 broad. The whole length of this vast tomb, which
is hollow underneath, is 40 feet; in breadth 14; and the
whole seems to have been inclosed in a circle of flag-stones
about 14 feet from the outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ross</span>, about 24 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Cork, may be visited from
Clonakilty.&mdash;See a small Gothic Cathedral; ruins of Abbey,
Barracks, and neat Market-house. Miss Plumptre describes
the surrounding scenery as extremely pretty. See curious
caves in the rocks by sea side. At Castlefreke good marine
scenery. Castlehaven has ruins of several Castles, and remains
of Spanish entrenchments in Elizabeth's time. At
Dunmanway see some romantic scenery, with a curious natural
wall of rocks. Glandore Bay is a most picturesque
scene resembling an inland lake. At Kilmacabra see Lough
Drine with Danish entrenchment on hill to the <span class="smcap">E.</span> The
lough is supposed by the peasantry to have the miraculous
property of shifting all its islands on some holy day every
year. At Miros are some curious rocks and caverns; see
also Mount Gabriel with most extensive prospect, with a
deep lough on its summit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Youghall</span>, about 24 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Cork,&mdash;is noticeable as
the spot where the first potatoe was planted in Ireland.
Some good scenery around it; and cheerful in the summer
as a watering place. See the Ch. a large Gothic structure
with six Gothic arches on each side of the nave; partly
suffered to decay, particularly the chancel, where there
is a very fine east window of the purest Gothic. Here are
several ancient monuments. The mineralogist will be gratified
by visiting Clay Castle, about 1 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> from the
town; a bold hill, on the strata of loose sandy clay, pieces
of which falling upon the beach become a hard firm grit like
freestone.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>MINERALS.</p>

<p>Coal is to be met with in the barony of Duhallow; in
the <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> also iron. In Muskerry in the <span class="smcap">W.</span> are curious red
and white slaty pebbles, and in other parts are limestone
and loam with symptoms of copper. But on the whole this
district, though interesting to the geologist, is very deficient
in mineralogy.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> extremity of Ireland, anciently inhabited by the
<i>Rhobogdii</i> and <i>Venicni</i>; but in more modern history known
as Tyrconnel. The whole of the western coast consists of
a range of mountainous rocks, which in some places throw
out branches that extend to the sea, or run between borders
of sand. Between the mountains in the interior of the
county there are extensive tracts of bog, in which are the
remains of immense forests buried deep in the bosom of
the vale, though at present the tourist travels for miles
without a single tree to solace his eye. One part of the
county, in the vicinity of Leichbeg and Glentes, presents
a view of most singular appearance, consisting of an almost
uninhabited waste of heath, with masses of granite protruding
from the sides of the mountains; whilst here and
there, wherever a little soil can be found, are small patches
of cultivated land, with small cabins formed of dry stone,
cement being unthought of. It is bounded by the Atlantic
on the <span class="smcap">N.</span> and <span class="smcap">W.</span>, by Tyrone and Londonderry on the <span class="smcap">E.</span>
and by Fermanagh and Leitrim on the <span class="smcap">S.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballyshannon</span>, about 10 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Donnegal,&mdash;presents
some pleasing scenery of beautiful landscapes, swelling
hills cultivated, and with the bay flowing up between
them. These hills are extremely picturesque, rising into
various outlines, and dying away insensibly into one another.
See Bridge of 14 arches; also the Salmon-leap, surrounded
by most romantic scenery; a fine fall of water; perpendicular
rocks forming the banks of the river, with bold views
of the sea. Here also are some ruins of the once famous
Castle of the O'Donnels, the turbulent feudal chieftains of
Tyrconnel; and &frac12; m. distant, in a secluded but finely picturesque
situation, the ruins of Asheroe Abbey. In the vicinity
several Danish Raths. Belleek is a pretty village, 8 m.
<span class="smcap">E.</span> of Ballyshannon, and at the end of Lough Erne, whose
waters here form two fine cataracts under perpendicular
and well wooded rocks. Several handsome seats, particularly
Castle Caldwell on the Lough, with ruins of several
ancient Castles; but in Fermanagh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">DONNEGAL</span>, the county town, is a decayed town 111 m.
<span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Dublin.&mdash;It contains little worth notice, except
an ancient castellated mansion of the Earls of Arran, which
with the river and bridge is considered by Sir R. C. Hoare
as forming a good subject for the pencil. Near it are the
remains of a Franciscan Abbey (1505) in a most picturesque
situation. See spacious market-place; mill-stone
quarries in vicinity. The finest view of the Bay is from the
bridge of Imber, whence towards the right is seen a lofty
but distant mountain, with cultivated fields in the foreground:
at the foot of another mountain a gentleman's
seat with well grown plantations strikes the eye; and to
the left the scene is diversified by a sand bank thrown up
by the sea, and a high ridge of plantation on the western
side of the river, with the bay appearing beyond it or seen
through its waving interstices. Barnmoor pass is highly
awful and grand, leading towards Lough Esk, about a quarter
of a mile wide and 3 m. long, formed by mountains rising
high on each side of a deep glen covered with heath, and
frowning in deathlike silence. Lough Derg, 6 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> is remarkable
for its Purgatory; founded as reported by St.
Patrick, in a small island about 130 yards long and 50 broad.
The Purgatory itself consists of a cave 16&frac12; feet long by 2
wide, so very low that a tall man cannot stand erect in it.
Around it are the remains of several Chapels and holy circles
dedicated to various saints of both sexes. Lough Esk
lies at the head of the valley which communicates with
Donnegal, and at the foot of the magnificent Ross Mountains;
round it the scenery is sometimes awfully sublime,
and sometimes rich and cheerful. The sportsman will find
red deer on the hills, and char in the lake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inishowen Barony.</span>&mdash;Even in Ireland, it is considered
wild, savage, and impassable, from want of good roads.
But Mr. Wakefield represents it in a very different light,
and worthy the notice of the tourist. The roads, he says,
are very good; the land better cultivated than any other
part of the county; whilst the views of Lough Swilly
from it are exceedingly grand. See the agreeably situated
house of the Bishop of Derry at Faun. Let the mineralogist
visit the Arigal, on the eastern bound of the county,
said to be the highest hill in the province; it is shaped like
a sugar-loaf, and contains a quantity of mountain spar, with
lead-mines in its vicinity. In this district is the parish of
Cloncha, where are some remains of a large stone Cross
sculptured with rude representations of various animals;
also part of a Druidical circle of 12 stones, 6 feet high,
forming a segment of a circle 60 feet in diameter. In the
same parish see the great peninsular rock of Dunmore. In
this parish are still preserved some traditionary fragments
of Ossian. In Clonmany parish see the picturesque scenery
round the Ch.; also a round tower forming part of the
ruins of an ancient Castle; near it a castle on a pyramidal
rock, not far from which is Mamore Gap, presenting the
most sublime scenery of mountains, rocks, and ocean,&mdash;a
district consecrated to the memory of Cuchullin and the
heroes of other times: a Druidical altar here, is called Cuchullin's
(or Fion Mac Cuil's) stone. Near Cromla, in this
vicinity, is the site of the ancient Tura, so famed in those
scattered traditionary fragments that form the basis of Mac
Pherson's modern Fingal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Killybegs</span>, about 12 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Donnegal, offers some
fine marine and mountain scenery. See ruins of Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Letterkenny</span>, about 25 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Donnegal, and 15 m.
<span class="smcap">W.N.W.</span> of Londonderry, forms a good station for visiting
the wild scenery towards the coast. At Ards Castle, see
ruins of Castle and Baltimore Ch. Dunfanaghy has some
castellated ruins in its vicinity. At Hornhead, 28 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>
from Letterkenny, see a remarkable cavern called Mac
Swine's Gun, on a rocky cliff 60 feet perpendicular. Of these
rocks the lower stratum is porous sandstone, hollowed into a
cavern by the violence and continual buffeting of the waves,
from whence an aperture proceeds to the summit. When
the wind comes from the <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> the billows being driven with
great violence into the cavern, the water thus forced to find
a passage through the aperture, rises to the summit of the
funnel, from whence it again descends with a most tremendous
noise. Near this is MacSwine's Castle, an ancient
edifice, now fitted up as a modern residence. See Rutland,
a modern fishing-town, worthy the notice of the statistical
tourist. Kilmacrenan, about 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, has some ecclesiastical
ruins, founded by St. Columb, of which the parish Ch.
forms a part. See the rock on which the O'Donnels,
princes of Tyrconnel, were always inaugurated; also Lough
Salt, in a romantic situation on the summit of a mountain.
Murkish Mountain, situated within 4 m. of two deep and
safe harbours, Dunfanaghy and Sheephaven, affords siliceous
sand in great abundance. Rathmelton is a beautiful
village on the banks of Lough Swilly: see Sir
J. Stewart's handsome seat. The scenery around is delightful;
much planting, a fine river, and every appearance of
increasing industry and comfort. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Rathmelton is the
bridge of Loughaugh, an arch of 52 feet span. Ascend
Mount Alt, on the summit of which a lake with most extensive
prospect, combining ocean and mountain scenery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lifford</span>, 28 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Donnegal, is prettily seated on
the river Foyle, and is the assize town for the county. The
tourist will here find the inhabitants a complete Scotch colony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rapho</span>, 24 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Donnegal, was an episcopal city, but
now a dilapidated village.&mdash;See the Episcopal Palace, once
a Castle which stood a siege in the Civil Wars: also the
modernized Cathedral. Near Ballybofy see Lough Mourne,
and the dreary mountains of Barnsmore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tory Island</span>, which lies about 3 leagues from the main,
<span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Sheephaven, contains the ruins of a monastery
and of seven churches, having formerly been a "station,"
or place of Catholic penance.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern picture of this county, as sketched by Mr.
Wakefield, is flattering to Irish pride, and shows what
may be done by industry. He observes that in the western
side in particular, the land is in a high state of cultivation,
and inhabited by a middle class of opulent manufacturers,
whose appearance and condition would do honour
to any country in Europe. Their habitations are well-built,
display great neatness, and are all whitewashed. The
whole tract is embellished with plantations; and, whether
owing to the wealth created by the linen manufacture, or
the trade carried on at Belfast and Newry, every thing exhibits
evident signs of increased population and industry.
The banks of the rivers Bann and Lagan are covered with
bleach-fields, and present that cheerful and pleasing scenery
which characterizes a manufacturing country, and excites
in the mind an idea of improved civilization. The whiteness
of the linen spread out in those fields, contrasted with
the greenness of the surrounding sward, produces an effect
on the eye not easily described; and the concomitant objects,
added to the bustle and activity of the people employed,
render the whole scene most interesting. In the
<span class="smcap">S.</span> the mountains of Mourne raise their majestic heads to
the sky, and afford much entertainment to the picturesque
tourist, who may visit them from Rosstrevor; and it is a
curious fact recently noticed, that a road leading to Carlingford
over one of the loftiest, is actually cut through
a stratum of sea shells (<i>Turbo littoreus</i>) of considerable
depth, and more than 1 m. in length. The roads are good
in all parts, and the accommodations comfortable. Bounded
on the <span class="smcap">N.</span> by Antrim, <span class="smcap">E.</span> by St. George's Channel, <span class="smcap">S.</span> by

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballynahinch</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Downpatrick, seated on
a small river nearly in the centre of the county, has been
long celebrated for its sulphurated chalybeate spa, at the
foot of Slieve Croob mountain at about 2 m. dist. The vicinity
is peculiarly romantic. See Ch., Charter-school, and
Dissenting Meeting-house. See on the summit of Slieve
Croob mountain a remarkable cairn, 80 yards in circumference
at base, and 50 at top; another near Annadorn in its
immediate vicinity with a rude stone chamber in the centre.
The space between Slieve Croob and Ballynahinch is
so completely occupied with rocks and hills, that anciently
it bore the name of Magheradrol, or Field of Difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banbridge</span>, about 18 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> from Downpatrick, has a
bridge over the Bann, and is in the heart of the linen manufacture.
At Gilford, 5 m. distant, is a chalybeate; and
the river scenery, especially in the vicinity of its bridge of
18 arches, deserves notice. At Warringston see Ch. with
curious roof of Irish oak; also a Danish rath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bangor</span>, a small town 21 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Downpatrick on Carrickfergus
Bay. See ruins of Abbey founded by St. Carigel
(555), with Ch. (1623). Near it is Groom's Port, where
Schomberg landed with K. William's forces at the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comber</span>, a thriving little town on Strangford Lough,
13 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Downpatrick, with pleasant lake scenery. See
ruins of Mount Alexander Castle; fine strand at low water,
and most excellent race-course. In this place the tourist
will hear much of a famous female spinner, Anne MacQuillin,
some of whose finest yarn, spun into 105 hanks to
the pound of flax, actually measured 214 English miles per
pound. To spin this required about a fortnight, and could
only be done in mild weather. At Castlereagh, 4 m., see
ruins of ancient Castle. At Drumbo, 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Castlereagh,
see ruins of Ch. and round tower, formerly an Abbey
founded by St. Patrick; and 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> the Giant's Ring,
already noticed as in the vicinity of Belfast. It is an ancient
circle and mound of earth 842 paces in circumference,
with a Druidical altar in the centre, consisting of four
masses of stone, with a larger one laid horizontally. On
the bank are the remains of a round tower. It is worth observing,
that although there are some lofty mountains in
its vicinity, yet a person standing at the Cromlech in the
centre has his view completely bounded by the earthen
mound, beyond which the sky alone is visible, and the effect
sublime. About 3 m. distant on the banks of the Lagan
is Newtonbreda, a pretty village with extremely
handsome Ch.; and near to it the elegant seat and park of
Belvoir. Saintfield, 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Comber, is an improving
town; near which is a Danish rath worth seeing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donaghadee</span>, the station for the Scottish packets, about
22 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Downpatrick, a comfortable town. See Gothic
Ch. and new market-place. The pier forms a pleasant
walk. See the rath 70 feet high on a natural mount, 140
feet in all. The summit is capable of holding 100 persons,
and the view, over the channel, of Scotland and the Isle of
Man is very extensive. Whilst in this vicinity, the tourist
will be amused by a marine trip to the Copland Isles, on
one of which, Cross Island, containing about 30 acres, there
is a light-house constructed of limestone found on the
spot. In one of them is a cemetery with the ruins of a Ch.,
also several cairns. See Portavo and ruins of Temple Ch.
on the beach, on the spot where St. Patrick landed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Downpatrick</span>, 74 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Dublin, is the county town,
pleasantly seated on an arm of Strangford Lough. See remains
of ancient Abbey and Cathedral, boasted of as the
burial-place of St. Patrick, St. Columb, and St. Bridget:
Town-hall; Market-house; Barracks; Gaol: on the <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>
is a conical rath, 60 feet high, inclosed by 3 ramparts; the
race-ground 1 m. distant. Struel Wells, celebrated as a
Penitentiary, about 1 m. from the town. At Ardglass, 5 m.

Bay in its vicinity has a beautiful grotto under a limestone
hill, with an intensely cold well. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of it is Ballyvaston.
See an extensive tract of land, rendered sterile by sand
from the ocean. Carreg Abbey; ruins of Abbey and St.
Finian's Well are near Ardglass; also Castle Screan, built
on a Danish rath, with several Druidical remains. Coil-bridge,
the Port of Downpatrick, leads to Inis Courcey,
where are some ruins of an Abbey (1180). Killough, 5 m.
<span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, is a pleasant village, with good harbour on the Irish
Channel. See Ch.; Horse-barracks; Charter-school, and
near it a mineral spring. In a rock near the shore runs
an oblong cavity, which at the ebbing and flowing of the
tide emits a noise like a hunting-horn: St. Scordin's Well
gushes out of a rock on the beach, and is never dry. Saul
Abbey in ruins, with some castellated remains, is about
2 m. from Downpatrick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dromore</span>, about 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Downpatrick, is a bishop's
see, but now merely a village.&mdash;See the very small
Cathedral and neat modern Episcopal Palace. Danish rath
on hill at <span class="smcap">N.</span> side, with a covered passage 260 feet to the
Lagan river. Chalybeate spring, said to be good in gravelly
complaints. Neat Market-house; Dissenting Meeting-houses,

large bay open to the Irish Channel&mdash;See extensive ruins
of ancient Castle on a rock, built by the Knights Templars,
but dismantled by Cromwell. Here the noble mountains of
Mourne appear to great advantage. Clogh, a small village
2 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, has a Danish rath surrounded by a broad deep
fosse, with plain strong Castle; and near it Mount Panther,
seat of the Annesleys. Castle Wellan has a small lake with
pretty scenery; near it, Briansford, a village seated midst
romantic mountain landscape, rocks, cataracts, &amp;c. New
Castle has some castellated ruins at the foot of Slieve Donard,
the highest of the Mourne mountains; and is a much
frequented sea-bathing place. The vicinity wild and sterile,
but alpine and highly romantic. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dundrum, at
Slidderyford, are remains of a Druidical circle. Tullymore
Park, near to it, is the seat of the Earl of Clanbrassil, and is
situated at one end of the mountains of Mourne, and within
2 m. of the sea. The country around it is wild and rocky,
exhibiting some scenes of singular beauty in the romantic
style. Two mountain torrents join in the Park, and form
sundry cascades in their passage to the sea, into which
they fall at Dundrum Bay. The house stands in the park,
and, though not lofty in itself, yet commands a fine prospect
from its elevated situation. It is an extensive edifice
with four fronts of 130 feet each, inclosing a square area,
and each front is different from the others; 10 m. from
Downpatrick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hillsborough</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Downpatrick, a modern
built town with excellent inn. See elegant Ch. with stained
glass windows; the mansion of the marquis of Downshire;

plenty of pike and trout in Lough Erin, and wild-fowl in the
extensive bogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Killyleagh</span>, 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Downpatrick, stands on Strangford
Lough, and is a thriving place, with handsome Ch. &amp;c.
It was the birth-place of the venerable Sir Hans Sloane,
founder of the British Museum. See the Castle. At Ardmillar,
6 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, is a chalybeate spring. Ringhaddy has
some remains of a Castle, and has long been famous for its
oysters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loughbrickland</span>, on the Dublin road from Belfast, is
about 24 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Downpatrick, on the borders of the
Jonesborough mountains, where there is much wild scenery,
and a small lake in its immediate vicinity where the sportsman
will find plenty of speckled trout. It is noted as an
encampment of K. William's army on their way to the battle
of the Boyne. From Ellenmoney, a bog near it, towards
Points Pass, run two rivers, one <span class="smcap">N.</span> the other <span class="smcap">S.</span> Near
it and at Scarvagh are remains of fortifications in the Civil
Wars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newry</span>, a thriving commercial town at the head of Carlingford
Bay, on the verge of the county, and about 25 m.
<span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Downpatrick.&mdash;A pleasant cheerful vicinity, and a
good central station. See canal, drawbridges, &amp;c. &frac12; m.
distant are the Creeve rocks, with ruins of old Chapel.
The mineralogist may here examine specimens of metallic
spar, ponderous and ferruginous. At Crownbridge, 1 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>,

small lakes in which are plenty of pike. The tourist may
also visit Warren's Point, where large ships are obliged to
lie, and where the whole line of coast presents a continuation
of gentlemen's houses and whitened cottages, enlivened in
the bathing season by numerous parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newtonards</span>, a comfortable town at the head of Strangford
Lough, about 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Downpatrick. See venerable
Ch., with some vestiges of an ancient monastery at
Moville 1 m. distant. Gransha, about 5 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, has a good
chalybeate, stronger than Tunbridge Wells, but little frequented
being in a wild boggy district. Not far distant is
Grey Abbey on the <span class="smcap">E.</span> shore of the Lough, founded by a
daughter of one of the kings of Man, whose statue is still
preserved. Part of it is fitted up as a parish Ch., and the
<span class="smcap">E.</span> window is a noble specimen of Gothic tracery. About
&frac12; m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Newtonards is Scraba mountain, lofty, but cultivated
nearly to the summit. Near to it are good freestone
quarries; and 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> a loftier hill, sometimes confounded
with it, called Karn Gaur or the Goat's Mount. The vicinity
is famous for goat's whey. See Mount Stewart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portaferry</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Downpatrick, is a town of
some trade at the mouth of Strangford Lough.&mdash;See ancient

<p><span class="smcap">Rathfryland</span>, about 21 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Downpatrick, is a
large pleasant village.&mdash;On summit of a hill see ruins of a
Castle. The country round it is very agreeable. See village
of Hilltown: Lissize, seat of E. Clanwilliam; and
Turkelly's Well, 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, a celebrated chalybeate for scrophulous
complaints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rostrevor</span>, about 22 m. from Downpatrick, is considered
the Brighton of Ireland as a watering-place, and
highly extolled for its romantic scenery; being seated on a
well wooded bank on a small arm of the sea, which stretches
into the country from Carlingford Bay. Sir R. C. Hoare
describes the entrance to it as very striking on approaching
from Dundrum; Carlingford Bay being so landlocked and
surrounded by mountains as to resemble a large lake; and
the tourist, passing through an irregular grove of tall and
aged ash trees, with the sea and whitened houses glimmering
between them, finds here a truly rural village retirement,
commanding within its immediate vicinity more
beauty than the generality of sea places; a dry soil,
shady walks, diversified rides, and good bathing. He describes
the most striking feature of this place to be a lofty
mountain covered chiefly with oak wood, feathered down
to the water's edge; underneath which is a little quay, from
whence there is a walk of &frac34; m. along the banks of the bay
completely arboured by oak trees, with a good road continued
along the coast under the Mourne Mountains to Dundrum
Bay. We recommend this spot more particularly to
the tourist, as Sir R. C. adds that he has seen no place
with a more pleasing combination of rural beauties; mountains
agreeably varied with wood, heath, and down, on one
side; others on the opposite coast (Louth) singularly cultivated
in small portions or strips resembling a quilt of
patchwork; between them an extended channel of water,
on the banks of which is the town of Carlingford with its
ruined Abbeys and Castle; a purling brook, fine trees,
neatly whitened cottages, &amp;c. and a clean good inn. Miss
Plumptre speaks of it in equally picturesque and admiring
terms. 1 m. see ruins of Kilbreny Ch. The tourist may examine
a romantic mountain road to Rathfyland; and the
mineralogist will find ample amusement on the lofty mountains
of Iveagh and Mourne, which extend far to the <span class="smcap">E.</span>
along the Irish sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strangford</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Downpatrick, is a small but
very ancient town, at the entrance of the Lough.&mdash;See
Charter School, and ruins of Castle Audley, and Walsh's
Castle, from the former of which there is a most extensive
view over the bay. Kilclief Castle has considerable remains.
The Lough possesses some very fine scenery, especially
towards its entrance, where through tracts of hilly grounds
the Irish Channel is seen at intervals and the lofty hills of
the Isle of Man. The town of Strangford in the bottom is
pleasantly situated amongst trees, contrasting well with
the bold mountains of Mourne in all their sublimity. Near
is Castle Ward, the seat of Lord Bangor, with the peculiarity
of two fronts, one Grecian the other Gothic. See
the fine grounds and extensive prospects.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> county offers to the tourist a complete epitome of the
whole Island. In the northern district are many bogs, yet
in various points the most beautiful scenery opens to the
view, presenting numerous villages with highly ornamented
mansions and villas scattered around; except in some few
spots, trees indeed are wanting; and extensive salt marshes
spread towards the coast. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of the Liffey there is very little

<p><span class="smcap">Balruddery</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Dublin, lies on the coach
road, and, though but a village in decay, may form a temporary
station for the tourist to examine the northern district;
or he may stop at the Man of War Inn, 2 m. nearer
to the capital. Balbriggan, is a good fishing village 2 m.
distant; see Cotton Manufactory; and the mineralogist
may examine the veins of sparry micaceous stone, of copper,
and sulphur, recently discovered. Near the sea coast
is Baldungan Castle, now a mass of ruins, having been taken
and dismantled by Cromwell; yet enough remains to
give interest to the legendary stories connected with it.
Its architecture is of the 13th century, combining the domestic
with the castellated form as a baronial residence,
and said by tradition to have contained a nunnery and a
friary within its walls, whose religious occupants sought
protection here during the intestine warfare of early times.
The situation is pleasant, with a most extensive view in all
directions; and there still remain two large towers at the
west end with a parapet in front that covers the passage
between them, the whole richly mantled with ivy: besides
which many of the domestic apartments may be traced in
the adjoining building, the approach to which is by staircases
in the towers, leading also to the battlements. See
also the Chapel and cemetery. At Grace Dieu are some
remains of a Nunnery (1190). Holm Patrick has some venerable
remains of a Ch. dedicated to the tutelar saint,
who made this place his residence. Naul, a small village
14 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from Dublin, upon the borders of Eastmeath,
deserves a visit to its very beautiful glen, whose romantic
rocks, cascade, and rugged caves, are finely contrasted by
the picturesque ruins of its ancient castle. See the waterfall
called the Roches, and ruins of Snowton Castle. Patrick's
Isle has the ruins of an ancient Ch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dublin</span>, says Sir R. Hoare, is more remarkable for its
fine public buildings than for its squares or streets: the
latter, though planned upon an extensive scale, want neatness
and symmetry; but the former unite elegance of design
and grandeur with good execution. As this is probably
the first spot visited, we may observe that the view in approaching
the bay is delightful. On the left is seen a rich
and well-cultivated bank covered with villages and cottages,
and backed by the Wicklow Mountains, towering to a considerable
height and fading into the purple of distance.
To the southward are seen Sea View and the Black Rock,
about 4 m. from the capital, studded with white cottages for
summer residents; to the north a more level country extends
towards the Hill of Howth covered with villas,
amongst which is the architectural <i>bijou</i> belonging to Lord
Charlemont, known by the name of Marino. On approaching
the harbour the stranger is agreeably struck with the
appearance of commercial activity, the range of shipping
extending nearly a mile into the city, their masts resembling
an immense forest. As he advances the scene becomes
more interesting; but to enable him to investigate
it at his leisure we shall arrange all the objects of curiosity
alphabetically under their various heads.</p>

<p>The <i>Bridges</i> are numerous, convenient, and the new
ones elegant. Carlisle bridge forms a magnificent junction
of the finest streets in the city. Essex bridge, near the
Castle, is a miniature of Westminster bridge. Sarah bridge
of one arch, 104 feet span, is compared to the Rialto at
Venice. The quays are well built and extensive; but the
river is an unpleasant object except at high water.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>The <i>Churches</i> are very numerous, besides Meeting-houses,
and Catholic-chapels. Christ Church, the Priory
of the Holy Trinity, is of ancient date, erected by a Danish
prince in 1038, and much enlarged by the addition of various
chapels by adventurers in the reign of Hen. II. Here
they show a monument, said to be that of Strongbow Earl
of Pembroke, the principal invading chieftain; an opinion
certainly confirmed by Sir Henry Sydney, in 1570, who restored
the monument after it had been broken by the fall
of the roof; but Leland asserts that in his time an inscription
in Gloucester Cathedral expressly stated that to be his
place of sepulture. To the left of the high altar, see a
costly marble tomb of an Earl of Kildare, in 1743; opposite
to this, one of Secretary Agard in 1577; also the singular
musical epitaph of Dr. Woodward. The architecture
of the exterior is various, Saxon and Gothic; the inside an
incongruous mixture of Gothic and Grecian. The Round
Ch. deserves notice for the singularity of its form; and St.
Catherine's on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of Thomas-street has a handsome
modern front. St. Patrick's Cathedral is a fine object
of ancient ecclesiastical architecture, but surrounded
by filth and poverty of the most disgusting kind. It is of
various dates, from 1190 down to 1750, when the lofty
spire was erected; and part, including the steeple, was re-edified
in 1370, after partial destruction by fire. The Virgin's
Chapel is of the year 1271; but the whole is now in
such a ruinous state that Sir R. C. Hoare fears its speedy
downfall. He recommends the Chapter-house and choir
as the best specimens of its architecture. On the right of
the altar see the very curious monument of the Boyle family,
rising nearly to the ceiling; on the opposite side, the
tomb of Lord Ranelagh; a tablet to the memory of Dean
Swift, and near it one for Stella; another to Sir H. Wallop;
and a bust of the celebrated but eccentric George
Falkner.</p>

<p>The <i>Hospitals</i> are numerous and well regulated. The
principal are, the Blue-coat Hospital at Oxmanton Green,
for sons of decayed freemen; Foundling, spacious and airy;
Kilmainham, for soldiers, on the plan of Chelsea on a
grand scale; Magdalen, in Leeson-street, with Sunday
service; Marine School, on Rogerson's Quay; Incorporated
Society's Establishment, in Lower Bagot-street, for females
educated at public expense, until apprenticed; with
many others.</p>

<p><i>Literary Societies.</i>&mdash;The Institution in Sackville-street
has a good library, lecture- and news-rooms; good collection
of minerals and marbles. The Dublin Society has a
fine Museum of Natural History, particularly in minerals;
good library, laboratory, lecture-room, exhibition of paintings;
Botanic Garden at Glasnevin, and Observatory at
Dunsink. Royal Irish Academy has literary meetings every
Monday.</p>

<p><i>Private Edifices</i>&mdash;are not very numerous. See Charlemont
House; Leinster House, fine Corinthian front, rusticated,
and Doric wings; Waterford House in Marlborough-street.</p>

<p><i>Public Edifices.</i>&mdash;The barracks consist of 4 noble squares.
The Castle, mean on the outside but splendid within,
contains Public offices, an Arsenal and Armory; elegant
modern Gothic Chapel, and Bermingham's Tower. Commercial
buildings on <span class="smcap">N.</span> side of Dame-street. To see the
Custom House with striking effect, it must be viewed from
the opposite side of the river, where the statues and decorations
present a fine spectacle. The internal arrangements
deserve notice. The long room is 70 feet square and
of course a practical bull. The Exchange merits peculiar
architectural attention, being a fine rotunda within a square,
having in the interior 12 fluted pillars of the Composite order,
32 feet high, with a highly enriched entablature crowned
by a handsome dome. The Law Courts form a magnificent
pile; the approach grand, the hall noble, and the
arrangements well suited to the purpose. Sir R. C. Hoare
objects to the architectural effect produced by the dome,
especially when viewed from the opposite side of the river.
See the Linen Hall. The Parliament House, no
longer used for its original purpose, presents a fa&ccedil;ade of
fine architecture perfectly in unison with the handsome
front of Trinity College. Post Office in Sackville-street.
Stamp Office occupies an elegant mansion in William-street;
once Powerscourt House. Trinity College forms
a very striking object when approached from Dame-street.
The tourist will notice the fine effect on entering the principal
court, particularly of two elegant stone buildings with
correspondent Corinthian porticoes on the right and left.
See the Library, a magnificent room, surpassed only in Sir
R. C. Hoare's opinion, by that of Trinity College at Cambridge:
it is 269 feet long, 50 broad, and 40 high. The &aelig;ra
of the University is the reign of Elizabeth, but the edifice
itself is modern. A handsome but not very extensive park
belongs to the University, in which, see the celebrated
Anatomical School, with wax preparations; also the Museum
and the Provost's House.</p>

<p><i>Public Places</i> are not very numerous. The Rotunda in
Rutland-square, attached to the Lying-in Hospital, is open
as a promenade with balls, concerts, &amp;c. The Theatre
Royal (Crow-street) is gloomy on the outside, but highly
embellished and convenient within.</p>

<p>The <i>Squares</i> and <i>Streets</i> are often spacious. College
Green has a statue of K. William III. in the centre. Fitzwilliam
Square, small but pretty. Merrion Square, open
and airy, with some good buildings. Mountjoy Square
enjoys a most extensive prospect, and is elegantly laid out.
St. Stephen's Green is the largest square in Europe. Sackville
Street is also the widest street, having been originally
a Mall, with houses built on each side. Great, however, as
these are, Sir R. C. Hoare passes on them some severe
criticisms, by no means unfounded.</p>

<p>In the <i>Environs</i>, see the Royal Canal and City Basin;
ride round the circular road for good views of the city; visit
the light-house at the extremity of a pier upwards of
3 m. in length; and ride over the Ph&#339;nix Park, 7 m. in
circumference.</p>

<p><i>Excursions</i> from Dublin, to the extent of a day's ride,
may be arranged in 4 directions, <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, and <span class="smcap">N.W.</span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, Beldoyle is a pleasant little village 6 m. near
the Hill of Howth, with enchanting marine prospects.
Clontarf, a neat village 2&frac12; m., a fashionable bathing-place.
Here fell Brian Boru, the Irish king, in a battle with the
Danes (1014). See the Castle and Ch.; also some lead
ore in the neighbouring quarry. Drumcondra, a pleasant
village, nearly unites with Dublin on the northern verge.
The old Ch. is neatly modernized, and contains a handsome
monument to the memory of Mr. Coghill, Chancellor
of the Exchequer in the last century; but the picturesque
tourist will be more interested by the grave of the
late antiquary, Francis Grose, whose graphic hand here
moulders in the dust. See the superb mansion of Santry,
1 m.; and the view from Cloghran Ch. on a lofty eminence.
Howth, 7 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, is well worth visiting from the metropolis
on account of its extensive prospects. See the
Light-house; the rocky island of Ireland's Eye; the ancient
Castle of the Earls of Howth; the ruins of an ancient
Chapel. The botanist will also find several medicinal and
fragrant plants among its rugged cliffs. Howth House presents
a venerable picture of antiquity to the eye of taste.
The surface of the peninsula on which it stands is sterile;
but swelling into a lofty hill is usually denominated the
Hill of Howth: its shores are rocky and precipitous, indented
with creeks for small craft, and abounding with
gloomy caverns in which seals and porpoises are often seen
rolling their unwieldy bodies. Howth contains several religious
fragments worthy of notice. The ruins of the Ch.
are extensive and picturesque, and there is something interesting
in tracing the vestiges of the ancient monastery
which once stood close to its hallowed walls. Entering at
the <span class="smcap">S.</span> door the visitor passes into a hall, out of which a
door opens into the church shaded by venerable foliage.
Beyond this is the kitchen, with the ruins of several apartments.
Close by it is an ancient moat; and a small rivulet
flows beneath the old battlemented wall. See the new
Pier; and make an excursion to Lambay Island, where are
ruins of an old Castle, and plenty of shell-fish and rabbit
shooting. Marino is a small Italian Casino, seated on a
pleasing lawn, margined on the higher part by a luxuriant
shrubbery. The whole possesses much elegance, lightness,
and effect, and commands a fine prospect. The
rising ground on which it stands slopes off to an agreeable
accompaniment of wood, beyond which, on one side is the
harbour, which here has the appearance of a noble river
covered with shipping. See the venerable Ch. at Artane.
Near it see the pleasant village of Raheny; and the venerable
Ch. at St. Douloghs, built before the 11th century,
most curious to the antiquary and architect.&mdash;In the SOUTH
EAST see Black Rock, a pleasant watering village, 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>,
beautifully situated on the bay, with extensive prospects.
Visit Sea point, and obelisk at Rochestown. Bullock is a
village on the sea coast, 7 m. from the capital; much frequented
as a watering place. On the cliffs are the extensive
ruins of an old castle, of uncertain antiquity; also a
Druidical cromlech in a glen, deserving the notice of the
picturesque tourist. Dalkey, a village on the sea shore,
contains the ruins of two old castles. The island opposite
to it has the ruins of a Ch. and vestiges of an ancient sepulture.
Also a martello tower. The iron-bound coast is
very romantic towards Killeny Hill, from whence are
some charming prospects, especially from the obelisk on
the summit. In tracing the bold and striking scenery towards
Bray, the tourist will not omit Mount Druid, the Circle,
Gothic Tower, and ruins of Killeny Ch. Donnybrook,
on the extreme limits of the city, has a venerable Ch.; go
on to the magnificent mansion of Viscount Fitzwilliam, at
Mount Merrion; and to Stillorgan, 4 m., with most extensive
prospect from the Obelisk. Dundrum, 4 m., is noted
for goats' whey: see deep Glen and ancient Castle; enchanting
scenery, and extensive prospects. Dunleary, 5 m.,
is a thriving village, with numerous natural beauties and
much recent improvement. See Martello Towers. At
Rath mines, close to the city, see the ruins of Baggotsrath
Castle, celebrated in the military history of this part of the
island during the civil wars. Loughlinstown has in its
vicinity the venerable ruins of Tallagh Ch., with curious
sepulchral Crosses in an ancient cemetery, marked by legendary
superstitions. Rathfarnam, 3 m., beautifully seated
on an eminence, has near it the magnificent Castle of the
Morgans of Ely. The elegant seat of Marloy, and Southwell's
Glen, with most romantic scenery; Druids altar, and
ancient Judgement Chair of the Brehon Laws. The pedestrian
may here spend a day delightfully.&mdash;In the SOUTH
WEST, Chapelizod, a handsome populous village, is close
to the Ph&#339;nix Park, and famous for its Strawberries. See
picturesque and venerable Chapel, and fine scenery towards
Lucan. Clondalkin is a village about 4 m. from
Dublin, and worthy the notice of the tourist for its round
tower, 84 feet in height, close to a church of modern erection,
but surrounded by ancient ruins supposed to belong
to a Danish palace, and an archiepiscopal see. Tallagh,
5 m., a straggling village. See venerable archiepiscopal
palace, now deserted: also fine prospect from summit of
the hill; and Timoon Castle in ruins. In the NORTH WEST,
see Castleknock, a small pleasant village, 4 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, and its
old Castle in ruins, built in the reign of Hen. II. and commanding
a fine view. Near it is the venerable ruin of
Drymnagh Castle, in a most romantic spot; also Dunsink,
where stands the Observatory. Glasmenogue, in the vicinity,
is a station for the passage-boats on the Royal Canal;
an excursion on which cannot fail to amuse the tourist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glasnevin</span> is 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Dublin.&mdash;See the Botanic Garden
of the Dublin Society, well laid out and conducted
upon the Linnean System. Its hot-houses possess an immense
variety of curious exotics, and the whole extent is
little short of twenty acres. Luttrell's Town, 3 m. from
Dublin, through the Ph&#339;nix Park: a fine seat, with handsome
lawn bounded by rich woods, through which are many
ridings 4 m. in extent, leading through a romantic glen by
the side of a stream falling over a rocky bed, amidst the
dark foliage of steep slopes through which the Liffey is
heard or seen at intervals; the whole is of great extent,
and forms a most picturesque retirement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leixlip</span> is a pleasant town 8 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Dublin, on the
very verge of the county, with a good Inn.&mdash;See Carton
(Kildare), the elegant seat of the Duke of Leinster; also
the Castle, with fine grounds and romantic scenery: the
ruins of Confy Castle; and beautiful vale watered by the
Liffey. Ballymore Eustace has a good bridge over the
river, close by where the Liffey issues from the romantic
dell of Phollaphuca (Wicklow). See ruins of a Castle.
Lucan, 6 m., is a delightful village, with sulphureous
chalybeate in a grove on the banks of the river. See the
house and picturesque ground; also Iron-works, Calico-mills,
and Limestone quarries.</p>

<p><a name="Swords" id="Swords"></a><span class="smcap">Swords</span> is 6 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of the capital, on the great northern
road, and contains several specimens of antiquity. See the
Castle, of which a large square tower with massy fragments
of walls still remains; also the ruins of the Ch.,
with a round tower 73 feet high and 55 in circumference,
in very good preservation. Here also were an Abbey and
Nunnery, of which some vestiges may yet be traced. At
Brennanston, about 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, see Druidical Cromlech, six
upright, and 1 horizontal stone, 14 feet long and 12 broad.
Lusk, about 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, is highly deserving the notice of the
antiquary for the curious architecture of its Ch., consisting
of two long aisles, separated by a screen of seven arches.
The east end only is at present appropriated to public worship;
but the west end is remarkable for its square steeple
with round towers at three of the corners, whilst opposite
to the fourth is a round tower insulated, in very good preservation,
and loftier than the others. About 3 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> on a
rising ground near to the bay of Mallahide, is a curious
old Castle, pleasantly situated on a rising ground, surrounded
by fine timber, commanding a most extensive and
beautiful view of the coast, together with a good prospect
over the adjacent country; said to have been either built,
or to have received considerable repairs and additions,
in the reign of Edward IV. Latterly it has been solely
used as a family mansion, but formerly as a place of defence.
The edifice is large, irregular, and unequal in its
height; it is nearly square, and has an area or court within.
The entrance is on the east front, by a flight of stone
steps; and the hall is large, its ancient appearance corresponding
well with the outside. There are ten rooms on a
floor; one of which, a parlour, is wainscoted with oak,
which presents a curious specimen of antique carving.
The lower story is vaulted, founded on a limestone rock,
and contains the servants' offices.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kells</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Trim, being pleasantly seated on
the Blackwater, forms a good station for the western part
of the county. See the Market-house on the site of an
ancient Castle; also curious stone Cross, much decayed,
but decorated very richly with figures of men, beasts,
flowers, &amp;c. Here is a remarkable round tower, 90 feet in
height and 16 in diameter, with walls 3 feet in thickness.
It is close to the Church, at an opposite corner of which,
and detached, stands a square tower with a spire, the remains
of an ancient edifice now destroyed. At the back of
the town there is another small round tower; also a small
stone building arched with flags, called Columkill's Cell,
supposed to be the first Christian oratory erected here.
The Ch. is modern; and in the cemetery a curious sculptured
cross. See the noble mansion of the Marquis of
Headfort in its vicinity, and its extensive grounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Navan</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Trim, stands very pleasantly on the
Boyne, and has a considerable trade. Its vicinity has much
picturesque scenery for the pedestrian tourist. See the
Tholsel; and the remains of several ancient tombs in the
Abbey cemetery, adorned with sculpture. The beautiful
episcopal palace of Ardbraccan, 2 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, displaying
simplicity of design with accuracy of execution, is
built of a remarkable limestone with a very fine grain,
found in the immediate vicinity. The quarry is worth
visiting. The limestone is capable of being worked into
any form for building; is susceptible of a fine polish;
and though white when it comes from the chisel, acquires
a sober grayish tint after exposure to the air. Its
strata are horizontal and of various degrees of thickness,
from four inches to two feet; and columns have been raised
and worked of 9 or 10 feet in length, and from 15 to 18
inches in diameter. A short distance from Navan, close to
the village of Donoghmore, and standing on an eminence
near the road leading to Slieve, is a round tower adorned
with sculptures of the Crucifixion over the doorway. It is
not in very good preservation; and the ancient Ch. attached
to it is totally in ruins. Dunmore Castle is a building of
very early date, but almost new built as a castellated house
at the close of the 17th century, and now presenting a curious
specimen of those turbulent times in its lofty towers
and heavy walls, diversified only by a few windows close
to the battlements. In the vicinity of Dunshaghlen see
Dunsany and Killeen Castles, mansions of Lords Dunsany
and Fingal. Near the latter examine the Ch. and sepulchral
antiquities. The tourist who is partial to extensive prospects,
may visit the Hill of Screen, on whose summit is a
Ch., presenting from the battlements of the ruined belfry
a most delightful view over a richly cultivated country.
The edifice itself is in a state of dilapidation, except part of
a chapel fitted up for divine service; but the antiquary may
amuse himself with examining an ecclesiastical figure in
relief over the southern entrance; also some crosses and
curious old tombstones scattered over the surrounding cemetery.
At New Grange is a very curious specimen of
early Celtic antiquity, consisting of a most extensive barrow
composed of stones and earth, formed with infinite labour
and exhibiting considerable artificial dexterity. In
this there is a cave which well deserves the notice of the
antiquary: from the horizontal floor of this cave to the
summit of the mount, is about 70 feet; the circumference
at top is 300; and the base covers two acres of ground;
the whole founded on an amazing collection of stones, and
covered with gravel and earth. Slane, about 6 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, on
the <span class="smcap">N.</span> side of the Boyne, presents several curious ruins to
the lover of antiquity. Some remains of an Abbey or College;
lofty tower with Gothic windows. Here is also
a Hermitage, said to be that of St. Ere, consecrated by
St. Patrick in 512. Near this, on the banks of the Boyne,
see the magnificent seats of Earl Conyngham (Slane Castle),
and Mr. Lambert (Beaupark), whose grounds have
the appearance of one domain, being separated only by the
river running between romantic rocks, the summits and
sides of which are partly adorned with wood; and the
union of this scenery, combined with the dressed lawns of
these two seats, renders the whole prospect highly interesting.
Tarah has long been celebrated in Irish history as the
place of coronation of the Irish monarchs. Here are some
remnants of Danish fortifications, and the ruins of a Ch.,
sombre and picturesque. See ruins at Trevet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trim</span>, 22 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Dublin, is the assize town.&mdash;See
picturesque ruins of an ancient Castle, celebrated through
all the periods of Irish history; once the property of Mortimer
Earl of March: situation romantic; many ruins of
Monasteries. The ruins of Bective Abbey stand on a high
bank of the Boyne, about 3 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Trim. Here the tourist
may contemplate the domestic range of buildings connected
with the Ch.; and, as the walls and division of the apartments
are still pretty entire, may form a very good idea of
monastic manners. The <span class="smcap">S.</span> side a range of 12 arches, supported
by clustered pillars, opens into a gallery which also
runs along the <span class="smcap">W.</span> From this gallery is an opening into a
range of cells, gloomy and inconvenient, and seemingly
fitter for the dead than the living. The whole place is indeed
sombre in the extreme, with its Gothic doors and windows
in several places, and projecting towers and turrets.
The outline is picturesque, and deserves a visit. Clonard
has some curious monuments in its Abbey ruins. At Newton
are the remains of the Ch., belonging to a monastery
founded in the 13th century; though much shattered, yet
they have once been august, and are now sweetly enveloped
in ivy. Tradition attributes (falsely) an ancient tomb
to a daughter of King John. On the road from Trim to
Mitchelstown see the ruins of a square fortress with circular
turrets at the angles, called Scurlack's Town Castle,
seated on the borders of the river Boyne, which is here a
silent stream full of weeds and rushes.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> county will always be an object of interest to the
tourist, on account of Lough Erne, besides several smaller
pieces of water, on all of which are situated some of the
finest mansions and demesnes in the island. Its general
surface is mountainous, interspersed with extensive boggy
tracts, which rendered it, in early times, almost impregnable,
when possessed by the sept of M'Guires. Bounded,

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bellcoo</span>, 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Enniskillen, and on the verge of
the county, though a small is yet a neat village, and may
form a station for the tourist, being seated on a considerable
stream that runs into Lough Mac Nean, and thence to
Lough Melve. The well called Davugh Phedric is noted
as a cold bath, and nearly equal to Holywell in force. See
ruins of Ch. 1 m. From hence also the tourist may visit
Florence Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belleek</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Enniskillen, is a pretty village,
with a very fine waterfall: ascend a hill with a battery on
its top, from whence is seen a woody eminence with an
insulated rock covered with shrubs, along which the
stream passes with great rapidity, falling about twenty feet,
and forming a most enchanting prospect. See it also from
the bridge. It stands at the outlet of the lake, close to
the verge of Donnegal. See Castle Caldwell on the
northern shore, seated amidst promontories of thick wood
that shoot into Lough Erne, with every variety of wood and
lawn and water that can delight the eye. Near it is Lewrel,
a demesne of singular beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enniskillen</span>, 80 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Dublin, is nearly in the
centre of the county, and seated at the junction of the two
divisions of Lough Erne, so as to form a convenient station
for the whole county. It was celebrated in the wars of the
Revolution by its heroic defence against James's army; and
part of the military works yet remain near the bridge. See
handsome barracks; superb school-house; and the
Castle. Visit Bellisle, the romantic residence of the late
Lord Ross; Castle Coole, 1 m. dist. Lord Belmore, an
elegant mansion of Portland stone; Daughtons, 4 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>,
where are some curious caves; Florence Court, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>,
on the southern shore, a very superb modern edifice,
seated at the foot of lofty mountains, in the midst of a
highly cultivated demesne, with most romantic prospects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lisnarick</span>, about 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Enniskillen, is a small
hamlet, but may suffice as a station for the northern bank
of the lower lake. Close to it is Castle Archdall, a magnificent
mansion; and 2&frac12; m. further, see Cash, an inconsiderable
village, but amidst fine scenery, with ruins of a
Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lisneskea</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Enniskillen, is a decayed village,
but may serve as a temporary station for the Upper Lake;
and as there are many genteel residences in its immediate
vicinity, the tourist, if so inclined, may trust to Irish hospitality.
See ruins of old Castle at Calla Hill, across the
lake; ruins of an old Ch. at Donough, 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>; Gola, 5 m.

<p><span class="smcap">Lough Erne</span> is 20 m. in length, and covers nearly
48,000 acres. It has been little noticed by tourists; yet
its beauties deserve some leading directions. Those who
have time to spare, or the artist who wishes to devote his
time to study, may employ a few days very agreeably in
perambulating its limits, so as to catch each point of view
under the various effects of morning and evening tint, or
even noon-tide radiance; but where a day only can be allowed
for seeing it, that day will be most profitably spent
on the island of Bellisle, where the Earl of Ross has a most
delightful residence. Here we may introduce an observation,
regard to which will often be highly useful to the
picturesque tourist.&mdash;It is, that the same view presents a
very different appearance when seen at the commencement
and at the close of day. In no part of the world is this,
perhaps, more noticeable, than in Ireland, owing to its
moisture, raised into vapour by a meridian sun, condensed
by cold winds rushing in through extended valleys, through
the day, settling in the dells or fringeing the mountain tops
in the still repose of evening, or rising like a curtain at the
influence of the morning beam. In pursuance then of this
hint, the hurried tourist, especially if pedestrian, should
proceed to Bellisle at the earliest dawn, and he will find
himself sufficiently occupied until the nightfall in traversing
its limits round an extent of 200 acres consisting of all the
variety of hill and dale, with partial sprinklings of lawn, interspersed
with ancient woods of considerable extent, in
some spots exhibiting all the deep majesty of shade, in
others opening into more cheerful clumps, or scattered
breaks of foliage. The varied surface exhibits the whole
contents of this woody scenery to great advantage, presenting,
even in what may be called the home views, sufficient
amusement for a day; but much increased by its junction
with the surrounding scenery at every break in the
hills, and at every verdant point jutting into the lake, particularly
so in front of the mansion, where a reach of it
passes under the eye of the spectator, reflecting the fine
woods and rising banks that give beauty to the scene and
shelter to the house itself. This part of the lake, being
3 m. in length, possesses all the charms of distance, and
has in front another island clothed thick with wood encircling
a bold eminence, appropriated to the purposes of a
deer park, in the rear of which a lofty mountain gives
almost a magic relief to the whole. This is finely contrasted,
on a short turn to the right, by some clumps of
rich foliage, and by several pretty islands starting boldly
from the surface, broken into a thousand picturesque forms
by the windings of the lake, and the whole body of water is
lost in a narrow defile where hill on hill closes the view.
Here too is every facility for viewing the lake in a double
route; as the walks most commodiously surround the
island at its outermost limits, besides leading to the best
points of view in the interior; and indeed it will be proper
not to omit the prospect from a handsome temple which
commands the whole of this enchanting scenery. The
grotto ought also to be visited, and attention paid to the
effect on coming out of it, when the contrast presents a
beautiful effect, in two of these islands appearing to join, the
streight between them having the semblance of a deep bay,
whose extremity is lost amidst the sombre foliage in the
back-ground. Behind these is the hill of the deer park, the
lofty mountains behind which for a moment draw attention
from the nearer beauties; but these latter must not be neglected,
as their examination in all the neatness of artificial
culture contrasts finely with the bleak and wild surrounding
imagery of nature. The widest part of the loch is in the
vicinity of Castle Archdall, where it resembles the sea,
and presents a charming panoramic prospect if viewed
from the little island of Ennismachcent, no less than 27
isles and islets surrounding the spectator. The prospect
to the <span class="smcap">N.</span> is the finest, when Castle Archdall is seen in all
its glory of wood and water reaching on the left to a noble
bay of considerable extent, bounded by lofty mountains
softening into distance, and shrouding in their bosom a
much venerated Roman Catholic cemetery, with a large
stone cross standing on a pedestal at its entrance.</p>

<p>In Lough Erne, the most celebrated island for holy purposes
is <i>Devenish</i>, in which there are a round tower and
considerable ecclesiastical ruins, some as early as the 12th
century. These buildings are of the Augustinian order of
monks; and the most ancient part is called St. Molaise's
House, a vaulted building of hewn stone; coeval with
which, in Mr. Ledwich's opinion, is the round tower; and
both, as he supposes, of Danish origin.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> county is maritime, and of great extent, being the second
in the island. It contains several lakes; but as the scenery
round these is not very romantic, they are but little
known to the tourist; and the aspect is not improved by
the dry stone walls or hedges; except in the western district,
where the beautiful shores of Lough Corrib will repay
the trouble of a visit, through an extensive tract of irreclaimable
bog and mountain. On the sea coast it is picturesquely
broken by numerous arms of the sea; and its rivers
deserve the notice of the inquisitive tourist. Dr. Beaufort
observes, that several of these rivers are subterraneous
in part of their course: near the village of Shrull, on the
borders of Mayo, the Black river runs under ground for
about 3 miles; but the most remarkable fact is that of the
Moyne and the Clare, which unite their streams under
ground, alternately appearing and retiring from view at
the Turlachmore, which in winter forms a lake and in summer
a beautiful and sound sheepwalk, upwards of 6 m.
in length and 2 in breadth. Bounded <span class="smcap">W.</span> by the Atlantic;

<p><span class="smcap">Aghrim</span>, 24 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Galway, is a small village; but
noticeable as the scene of battle between Ginkle and St.
Ruth in the war of the Revolution, 12th July, 1691, when
the latter, with his French and Irish army, was completely
defeated. The scene of action was on Kilcomodon Hill.
See the beautiful demesne of Ballydonnellan, also Ballydugan;
ruins of old Castles; and the magnificent demesne

may be visited from Loughrea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athenry</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Galway, now in decay; once a
strong English fortification; its walls built in 1211. See
Dominican monastery, noble even in its ruins. The tower
and several of the gable windows are very fine; but its appearance
is much altered by a part having been fitted up
for the reception of the garrison, the cloisters forming the
modern barrack-yard. Ancient Castle of the Lords Birmingham,

<p><span class="smcap">Galway</span>, the county town, is 102 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Dublin, formerly

Gothic Ch.; massy Gaol; and coarse woollen manufacture.
The bay is very fine, sheltered at its entrance by the isles of
Arran; but the country around is described by Mr. Curwen
as having the most singular appearance he ever beheld,
resembling the seat of a volcanic eruption from the
immense blocks of limestone scattered over a space of
great extent, with scarce a symptom of vegetation. See
ruined tower of Ballensnave Castle; Caher Morres, a small

has extensive ruins of a monastery (1498). Turlaghmore,
already alluded to, may from hence be visited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lough Corrib</span> possesses some romantic scenery; and
is about 20 m. long, and at the broadest part 11; being
contracted in the middle so as to appear like two lakes.
The collector may here pick up some very good specimens
of pearls from a muscle peculiar to the lake. The scenery
on its western shores is a chain of wild and stupendous
mountains, with some few fertile valleys. It contains
many pretty islands; and here is caught the gillaroo trout,
with a gizzard like a fowl, esteemed a great delicacy.
Headfort, on its northern shore, is a well-built village, with
venerable Ch. and barrack; near it an ancient mansion of
the St. George family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lough Derg</span> is a wide reach of the Shannon, which

and some fine arcades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ouchterard</span>, 20 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Galway, is a small village,
but forms a good station for the tourist who will persevere
in examining the western district of the county.
Here is a chalybeate, and its situation is considered peculiarly
salubrious. If the tourist chooses, he may penetrate
to Ballynahinch, a small village, but worthy a visit, being
situated in that district called Connemara; mountainous,
and intersected by numerous bays affording great diversity
of scenery. It stands at the foot of the vast ridge of Beannabeola,
or the Twelve Pins, consisting principally of perpendicular
rocks, with a charming lake extending for several
miles in its immediate vicinity; round which the hills are
watered by rivers and small lakes, and sheltered by the venerable
remains of ancient woods, among which are to be
found a simple rude people, inhabiting what is generally
called "Joyce's Country," forming a distinct class in manners
and in appearance. The western shores of Lough Corrib
may be visited from Ouchterard; also Lough Mask.

This county was long impassable for tourists; but much
has been done by the resident gentlemen, who have
shortened many of the old roads, carrying them in straight
lines over rocks and morasses, deep glens and rugged
mountains; so that not only the approach to the Lakes of
Killarney, but also to many other interesting tracts, is much
facilitated. It is a maritime district, indented with numerous
bays and harbours; rugged and mountainous, but
justly celebrated for its lake and mountain scenery. It has
been observed indeed by Mr. Wakefield, that in this county
the attention of the tourist is so much occupied with Killarney,
that the romantic scenery in other parts is either
overlooked or forgotten;&mdash;yet it ought not to be consigned
to neglect, as there is a great deal of it (though inferior to
that of Killarney) which is still worthy of being noticed.
Bounded on the <span class="smcap">N.</span> by the Shannon; on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> and <span class="smcap">W.</span> by

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardfert</span>, 4 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Tralee, is now a decayed village,
though an episcopal see in early times. It has the ruins of
a splendid Cathedral, with curious monuments and gravestones,
and a sculptured figure of St. Brandon. Ruins of
round tower. To the <span class="smcap">E.</span>, ruins of Franciscan Friary, a venerable
structure, from whence follow road leading to the
sea and mansion of the Crosbie family. Visit Ballyheigh
bay with fine strand; ancient Castle of Ballykeal; Castle
on Ferrit Island; Kerryhead surrounded by picturesque
and savage wildness; Kilcroghan, where is a curious hermitage
cut in the rock, also a Danish fortification; Lixnaw
the ancient seat of the Earls of Kerry; Odorney Abbey in
ruins; remains of Rahanane Castle, once an episcopal residence;
and lofty round tower at Rattoo. The tourist
must employ a guide in surveying this district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Island</span>, 9 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Tralee, a decayed village on
the route to Killarney, though anciently the shire town.
See parish Ch.; roofless town house, barracks, &amp;c.&mdash;As
there are some decent inns, the tourist may from hence visit
some of the scenery to the <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Killarney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dingle</span>, 16 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Tralee, forms a station for the wild
western district.&mdash;See Gaol built on vaults of Old Castle.
Notice the various houses built in Spanish fashion, with
stone balconies. See the mansion of the Knight of Kerry;
the ruins of an ancient Monastery; also of part of the old
parish Ch. and monuments of the Fitzgerald family. 1 m.
<span class="smcap">N.E.</span> see the vitriolic spa of Ballybeg; also Burnham, or
Ballingolin Castle. Whilst exploring the wild beauty of
this vicinity, the tourist will be amply repaid for his labour,
by a journey across the Brandon mountains towards Tralee
Bay. The views which they afford are highly picturesque,
and the prospects from almost every eminence are very
extensive. Ventry Bay merits investigation; on the western
point, Caher Trant, are remains of a Danish entrenchment,
and another at Rathanane, near a ruined Castle of
the Fitzgeralds; also a stone Cell near it. Some historical
interest is given to this isthmus, by a tradition that it was
the last ground in Ireland possessed by the Danes; and
there is a curious story about it in Hanmer's Chronicle,
illustrative of the manners of those early times. A little
further west is what is esteemed the <i>furthest</i> extremity of
the island, to which, like Johnny Groat's house in Caithness,
is given "a local habitation and a name," its appellation
being "Tyvorney Geerane," or <i>Molly Geerane's house</i>.
From hence the tourist may visit Blasket Islands, remarkable
for the simplicity of the inhabitants, for ancient religious
ruins, and for a great variety of aquatic fowls, some
rivalling the ortolan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iveragh Barony</span> forms the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> extremity of Ireland,
and will afford great delight to a tourist who fears not
fatigue and privations. Visit the romantic Lake of Currane,
of an oval form, 3 m. in length, surrounded by
lofty mountains. In it are three small islands; on one of
which, ruins of a Ch. and Cell, with marks of foundations
under water. See the river Inny, with ruins of Ch. and
Bridge. Dowles Head is near Valentine Island: here are
several large Caves, one of which has an entrance so low
as scarcely to admit a boat with a man standing up, but
within it is as high as a Gothic cathedral. There is a
most curious echo; and when a person speaks, his voice is
so reverberated from side to side as to seem louder than a
speaking-trumpet. Glanbehy parish, the easternmost of
the barony of Iveragh, has a most romantic but dangerous
road, resembling that of Penmonmawr in Wales; and over
which indeed, according to the traditions of the country,
none but poets should attempt to pass; since in the opinion
of its neighbours it is necessary to make some verses to
its honour, otherwise, as they affirm, the traveller will
meet with some mischance. Perhaps it was some similar
superstition that gave rise to the custom of the <i>album</i> in the
monasteries situated in the mountainous passes of Switzerland
and Italy. The Hags-tooth mountain is of great
height, with many romantic lakes. Visit the Skelig Islands,
containing several ecclesiastical ruins, and the scene of
modern pilgrimages. They offer much amusement to the
geologist. Valentia, in this district, affords slight accommodation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kenmare</span> is a small neat town, within the compass of
the Killarney tour, and a good station for much romantic
scenery.&mdash;The approach to this town, even before it is
seen, is very romantic; along a road winding up to the
summit of a mountain, between which and another of tremendous
altitude, is a deep glen, where the scenery is much
improved by the contrast of the superincumbent rugged
barrenness. "Here," says Mr. Wakefield, "the eye is
sometimes attracted by a solitary herd of goats browsing
among the heath below; while cultivation, gradually extending
up the sides of the hills, forms a pleasing contrast
with the desert and more prominent features of the prospect."
In the vicinity are several small islands in Kenmare
river, consisting of beautiful specimens of variegated marble.
These islands are also interesting to the botanical tourist,
from the varieties of Arbutus and Juniper, with the immense
number of marine and aquatic plants which fringe
their romantic sides. See the Fairy rock, and Glanerought
vale.</p>

<p><a name="Killarney" id="Killarney"></a><span class="smcap">Killarney</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Tralee, and 144 from Dublin,
is the general station for viewing the Lakes, which take
from it their usual appellation; but properly Lough Lane.
It is a pleasant little town, and affords every comfort required
by the traveller; but its great charm is in the Lakes,
about 1 m. distant. A minute description of this beautiful
scene is beyond our limits: we shall therefore briefly record
the objects that deserve examination&mdash;but, for the convenience
of the solitary tourist, to whom the expense of the
usual exploratory routine would be enormous, shall first
point out a route that will amply gratify the finest taste
and the most insatiable curiosity. After visiting Mucruss
Abbey, take a guide at the foot of Turk's mountain, and
by a circuitous path climb its almost precipitous sides covered
with wood, pursuing the course of a little stream that
dashes from rock to rock concealed amongst shrubs and
trackless underwood, through which brush your way with
some little exertion until you arrive at an eminence opposite
Eagle-crag, from whence at one <i>coup d'&#339;il</i> you take in
the three lakes with their adjacent scenery. Here you
view the lower lake like a circular bason, bounded on
one side by romantic mountains, and having the rest of its
banks finely studded with the town of Killarney, the seat
of Lord Kenmare, Ross Castle stretching into the Lake,
Mucruss Abbey, and villa, together with its numerous archipelago
of islands, richly fringed with the arbutus tree.
The lake is then seen contracting into a narrow passage
with a small bridge, thence to Mucruss Lake at your feet,
of an oval form, and perpetually wearing a gloomy and solemn
appearance from the dark, sullen shadow of Turk's
Mountain that frowns upon it, covered half way up with
sombre firs. Beyond this is Mangerton, the highest mountain
in Ireland, at whose foot a serpentine stream unites
the upper lake with the others, traversing a valley or dell
between Turk's Mountain and the Eagle's Nest; behind the
latter of which, the seat of the celebrated echo, you will
see the sublime chain of mountains called Macgillicuddy's
Reeks. If your good fortune shall place you in this situation
whilst visiting parties are traversing the lakes with
their et-cetera of horns and swivels, then the effect is most
sublime, infinitely more so than can be felt by the tourists
on the bosom of the lake. Return by the Flesk bridge,
and conclude the tour by a visit to Aghadoe, Ross Castle,
and any other objects that may be pointed out by the numerous
guides who frequent this interesting spot. To
facilitate general investigation, we shall now sketch the
routes, and record a few observations of the most recent
tourists. The lakes are three in number: the largest, or
Lower Lake, contains 3000 acres; Mucruss Lake, to the
south, covers 640 acres; and the Upper Lake has 720.
Mr. Wakefield observes that since Mr. Young's visit to
Killarney, the timber which clothed the mountain Glenaa
has been cut down, and the stumps are now copsed; but
the young trees had not yet (1812) attained to a great size,
being only twenty feet in height. At that period, however,
they were sufficient to cover the mountain with foliage,
which, waving before the breeze, gave it a much
more lively and agreeable appearance. The trees also on
the islands near the town have fallen under the destructive
axe,&mdash;a loss much to be regretted by the lovers of sylvan
beauty, as it cannot be repaired until after a lapse of many
years. Mr. Wakefield adds, however, for the satisfaction of
the picturesque tourist, that although it is a general complaint
that the views of Killarney have been destroyed by
those sweeping falls of timber, yet he only acknowledges
them to be "injured, no doubt, in some small degree; but
the views here are still almost unrivalled, particularly in
regard to that species of beauty which arises from mountain
scenery of the most magnificent kind, and which the
hand of man has not the power to alter. It will therefore
remain to delight every traveller who has the pleasure of
seeing it, unless the face of the country should be changed
by some grand convulsion of nature." As a further guide
to the tourist it may be mentioned here that Mr. Wakefield
recommends the bridge which joins the peninsula to
Breechan Island, as a fine station for a view. The peninsula
itself he considers as very fine: to the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, see Mangerton
and Turk mountains in all their glory, sinking down
to the rugged point at the Eagle's Nest, where there is a
view of Glenaa, the immediate foreground being filled up
with Breechan and Dyne's Islands, beyond which is seen
the Lower Lake, with Ross Castle, whilst the distance is
completed by the town of Killarney, and the island of Innisfallen.
The Upper Lake he describes as an immense reservoir,
in a hollow between stupendous mountains, the
rugged, rocky, and almost perpendicular sides of which
may be said to overhang the water, whilst the whole scenery
is of the most awful and extraordinary kind, such as
very seldom occurs, and on a scale of magnificence hardly
to be equalled any where else, except in the wildest districts
of Switzerland. Sir R. C. Hoare observes, that the
collected beauties of this favoured spot are so great, so
varied, and so superior to any thing that he had ever seen
in Italy, Switzerland, or England, that to delineate or describe
them he felt impossible. His route was to embark
at Ross Castle, then stretch across to Innisfallen and see
ruins of Abbey thickly embosomed in wood; thence in a
westerly direction to O'Sullivan's Cascade, finely disposed
in a thick forest, whence he coasted under Tomies mountain,
where the view opens magnificently at Glenaa Point,
where see the cottage. From thence to Turk's Lake under
Brickeen bridge. See Turk's Mountain, majestic and perpendicular.
Back to Glenaa Cottage to dine, and return
to Killarney. On the following day proceed to Mucruss;
ruins of Abbey: eminence in park, with bewitching view of
Mucruss, Lower Lake, and distant mountains, a most exquisite
panorama. The Upper Lake occupied a third day.
Embark at Ross Island. Stretch across to Glenaa, where
tourists must land whilst the boat is tracked or pushed up
a shallow stream. Examine the arbutus. The boat is
again tracked at the old weir bridge, where view the
Eagle's Nest, and fire a swivel for the echo, or sound the
bugle-horn. Enter the Upper Lake; view the Sugar-loaf,
the reeks, and Purple mountain. Accommodation at cottage
on Ronan's Island; but the tourist must carry his own
provender. See long-extended range of rock and wood at
Cromiglaun; descend the lake, and notice the numerous
grotesque insulated rocks and romantic bays. A fourth
day spent in visiting the <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> shores of the lake by land,
leads to the gap of Dunlo, scenery truly alpine, and highly
deserving the artist's attention. Mr. Weld's routes can
only be followed by a resident tourist; but we must record
his recommendation to view the lakes by moonlight. Miss
Plumptre first ascended Mangerton, and praises the effect
of a bugle-horn at the Devil's Punch-bowl. On a second
day she visited the Upper Lake; then the Lower; and on a
third day, the Gap of Dunlo, Dunlo Castle; finishing on the
fourth, by visiting Mucruss, the scenery in its vicinity, and
Turk's Lake. Mr. Curwen embarked at Ross Island, visited
the rock called O'Donoghue's prison, Cherry Island,
Glenaa, the first day. The second day was spent on the
Lower Lake; thence to Turk's Lake, Upper Lake, Eagle's
Nest, Ronan's Island; alpine scenery of M'Gillicuddy's reeks,
3695 feet, and superior in effect of sublimity to Mont
Blanc. Return by Turk's Lake and through the islands to
Ross. Having recommended the ascent of Mangerton to
the tourist, it may be proper to point out the objects which
will then gain his attention; and, on this route, following
Mr. Wakefield, it may be observed that on attaining a certain
height, the Lower Lake, then the only one visible, has
the appearance of an inundated marsh; but, ascending still
further, the channel to the Upper Lake and a fine expanse
of mountain scenery burst suddenly upon the view, as if by
some magic charm; the whole forming a most extensive
landscape, enriched by the variety of tints arising from the
a&euml;rial perspective fading into the remotest distance. Near
the summit is the crater of an extinguished volcano, now
called the Devil's Punch-bowl, but little more than a large
hole filled with water; proceeding a little beyond this, a
new prospect opens with grand effect upon the eye, showing
the Iveragh mountains like an ocean of wild confusion,
with that large arm of the sea, called Kenmare river,
stretching a great way inland, and beyond all, the wide
expanse of the mighty Atlantic, seeming in the distant horizon
to unite its azure surface with the fainter coloured
sky: to the <span class="smcap">S.</span> is seen Cape Clear; to the <span class="smcap">N.</span> are the blue
Dingle mountains, M'Gillicuddy's reeks immediately
towering above the spectator, whilst the eye, glancing towards
the interior of the island, catches a partial view of
the far distant Galtee mountains of Tipperary. Grand as
this panorama must be, the guides will hold out a strong
temptation to the adventurous tourist to attempt the enjoyment
of one still finer by the ascent of M'Gillicuddy's
reeks, from whence the harbour of Cork appears like a
map extended at the spectator's feet, whilst to the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>
may be seen many of those huge headlands which form so
conspicuous a feature in that part of the Irish coast. Here
too the Dingle mountains dwindle into mere hills, and
Brandon hill, which, when near it, seems so tremendous,
now appears little more than a hillock; whilst the eye
passes over Tralee bay as a small indentation of the sea,
hardly worth while to notice, and lost in the extent of the
bay of Galway and the mountains which surmount it. In
short, says Mr. Wakefield&mdash;an observation highly deserving
the tourist's attention&mdash;those who go to Killarney without
ascending <i>one</i> of those commanding heights, though they
may come away delighted with the high gratification derived
from the rich scenery of Mucruss, the beautiful appearance
of the islands emerging from the crystal flood,
and astonished by the singularly wild and rugged views
which the Upper Lake affords; yet will they know nothing
of those grand, awful, and sublime scenes exhibited by
nature, where objects of the most terrific kind are united
in the wildest and most fantastical manner, exciting sensations
not easily described in the mind of the admiring
spectator. Nor will the ascent of Mangerton be found a
difficult task even to the most timid: for various gulleys,
hollowed out by the winter torrents, afford a road so easy,
that the greatest part of the ascent may be accomplished on
horseback. The tourist must expect to find his expenses
considerable: he must carry his own provisions; and is expected
to find provisions for his guides, or pay 2s. each
per day extra. These guides will also force themselves
upon him to a much greater extent than is necessary. The
rates of the boats are regulated by Lord Kenmare's order;
but the boatmen always expect more. The most remarkable
objects in the vicinity are Aghadoe, 2 m. from Killarney,
with fine view of the lake, with ruins of Ch.; at Ardtully,
a geological curiosity of two rocks, one limestone
upon a gritty soil, the other grit upon a limestone basis;
Blackstones, a small village in the mountains amidst romantic
scenery; Dunkerran Castle, of high antiquity;
Dunlo, already mentioned: Glanfesk valley beyond the
Upper Lake; Glanerought vale towards Kenmare bay, highly
picturesque and romantic: at Kilgarvan, near it, the Fairy
rock, amidst the mountains, with impressions of human
feet; Killagh Abbey, a few miles <span class="smcap">E.</span>, in good preservation,
a ruin with noble Gothic window; and ruins of Kilcolman
Ch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tarbert</span>, 20 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Tralee, is a thriving village, and
contains a Sessions House, and a good inn with convenient
accommodation. Upon a gentle eminence in the outskirts,
stands the Ch. with a handsome steeple. Near to it is the
Public School. To the left of it is Tarbert House, the seat
of Sir Edward Leslie, in a situation which bears a striking
resemblance to Mount Edgcumbe. Tarbert is a good station
for those who wish to examine the romantic scenery
at the entrance of the river Shannon; especially as extending
westward towards the ocean. A ride along that coast
first presents Rusheen, a pleasing seat and plantations, and
Lislaghtin Abbey, with a good view of Scattery Island;
then the island and Castle of Carrigfoile, anciently a fortified
mansion of the O'Connors, almost impregnable in situation.
Beyond this see the ruins of Beal Castle, the
seat of a horrid murder detailed in the <i>Pacata Hibernia</i>.
Its vicinity is romantic, commanding fine prospects, and
abounding in game. To the west of it is a high cliff, called
the Devil's Castle, inaccessible to all but the winged creation,
whilst the shore at its base presents a great variety of
romantic caverns formed by the dashing of the waves of a
turbulent ocean, overshadowed by cliffs of most impressive
grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Listowell</span>, between Tarbert and Tralee, is a neat little
town on the banks of the Feal, with a decent inn. See the
remains of an old Castle with a very high circular headed
arch. On the banks of the river, see Woodford, with some
remains of an ancient Castle, the seat of the Knight of
Kerry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tralee</span>, 144 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dublin, is a corporate and assize
town, with a neat square in the centre surrounded by
the Court-house and Gaol.&mdash;See the old Castle of the Desmonds,
the Parish Ch., and some remains of an ancient
Dominican Convent. The town is finely situated at the
bottom of an extensive bay, surrounded by lofty mountains.
Near it is a chalybeate spring. 2&frac12; m. see Ballybegan,
with ruins of ancient Castle, and some curious caves, with
a subterranean river, and various specimens of stalactite;
also a quarry of dark grey marble interspersed with spar.
Mineralogists may trace a vein of potter's lead ore running
amongst the limestone rocks. Castlemain, about 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>,
is an inconsiderable place, but presents some pretty scenery
on the river Mang which falls into the bay. Between
Tralee Bay and Castlemain, are the lofty mountains of
Sliebhmish. On the top of Cahir Conregh is a circle of
massy stones, by some supposed Druidical, by others Danish.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>MINERALS.</p>

<p>Mangerton mountain abounds in variety of minerals;
whetstones; argillaceous iron ore; red and brown iron
stones; spicular iron ore, adhering to quartz; and numerous
siliceous stones, but no calcareous specimens.</p>

<p>Transparent crystals, generally known under the name
of Kerry stones, are found in various parts. Many of these
resemble the diamond in its property of cutting glass, but
soon lose their hardness. The mineralogist must principally
direct his search for them amongst the rocks and
cliffs on the sea coast. Coloured crystals are found in
the vicinity of the lakes: these often resemble emeralds,
topazes, and sapphires. Some real amethysts have also
been discovered.</p>

<p>Near Castle Island is found the once famous <i>Lapis hibernicus</i>,
or Irish slate, formerly of some officinal reputation,
abounding in common green copperas, or martial
vitriol; also at Tralee.</p>

<p>At Dune, near Tralee, are pyrites, with sulphur, and
iron ore.</p>

<p>Extensive iron works formerly existed at Glencarne, especially
near Blackstairs.</p>

<p>A salino-nitrous spring at Magherybeg rises out of the
sand; antiscorbutic.</p>

<h2><a name="KILDARE" id="KILDARE">KILDARE</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is an inland and small-sized county, soon traversed, and,
with the exception of numerous Danish mounts, containing
very little to interest the general tourist. It is, in short,
little more than an extent of bog; and the famous Curragh
of Kildare, so celebrated in the annals of sporting, is literally
nothing more than a boggy down of about 3000 acres.
Mr. Wakefield observes that the habitations of the poor are
so extremely wretched that they add the appearance of misery
and desolation to the general dulness exhibited by the
face of the country. Unfortunately there is scarcely any
thing to contrast with this; for the seats of the gentry,
though much admired, are far from being numerous.
Bounded by Meath on the <span class="smcap">N.</span>; Dublin and Wicklow, <span class="smcap">E.</span>,
Carlow <span class="smcap">S.</span>; and <span class="smcap">W.</span> by King's and Queen's Counties.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Athy</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Kildare, celebrated as the scene of
battles in early history.&mdash;See ruins of two Monasteries.
At Ardee, 1 m., Danish Rath. At Carmen, 5 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, Rath
on conical hill, with extensive prospect. See Kilberry
Abbey, and Kildangon Castle, in ruins. At Maistean,
field of battle where bones are still dug up, of great antiquity.
Rheban, 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, has a quadrangular entrenchment,
the remains of an ancient city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballitore</span>, a beautiful village, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Kildare,
situated in a valley on a winding stream. It is a colony of
Quakers, with houses remarkable for neatness, cleanliness,
and elegant simplicity, with highly cultivated gardens.
See Belan House, the seat of the Earl of Aldborough,
erected on, or near to the ruins of an old Castle which was
demolished by Cromwell; after which another mansion was
raised, since pulled down and rebuilt. It stands low, near
the junction of two streams, which at the distance of 4 m.
fall into the Barrow. Plainness and convenience seem to
have been attended to on its erection, more than elegance,
though handsome and substantial; the front and rear composed
with breaks and ornamented with corner stone work;
and the whole forming a good object at the end of a magnificent
avenue. The visitor will be shown a bed which
stood in the old mansion, in which it is said, by tradition,
that both King William and King James slept in the course
of the year 1690. The demesne is very extensive, and has
the singularity of being in five counties, Kildare, Wicklow,
Carlow, Queen's, and Dublin; and seven others may be
seen from an eminence in the grounds, King's, Meath,
Westmeath, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, and Tipperary.
Timolin, 3 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, see ruins of Castle, and Moone Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Carberry</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Kildare, is a station for
the <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> part of the county. See ruins of ancient Castle,
(1180) with extensive prospect; also Newberry, a handsome
seat of Lord Harberton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Dermot</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Kildare.&mdash;See ruins of
Franciscan Friary, and Ch., close to which a round tower
in good preservation, and beautifully enveloped in ivy; also
remains of Castle, two stone Crosses, and three Pillars of
great antiquity. A place of early celebrity, but now in
decay. Kilkea Castle, 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, the property of the Duke
of Leinster, presents the tourist with the agreeable picture
of an ancient Castle fitted up for modern residence. Grose
gives a very interesting engraving of it; and he describes it
as situated on a rising ground and commanding an extensive
prospect: near it is a Ch., and the river Grisso runs at
a small distance. Having been partly rebuilt in the 15th
century, it has a bawn or inclosure entered by an arched
gateway, defended by a round tower which projects from
the castle itself. In the front of the castle is the principal
entrance, with an outer staircase. The whole forms a
very interesting object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clain</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Kildare, stands pleasantly on the
Liffey; Ch. with lofty steeple; ruins of Abbey; ancient
Castle, and extensive Rath; Aqueduct Bridge near it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilcock</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Kildare, and on the verge of the
county, is a populous but straggling village. Suffered
dreadfully from the rebels in 1798. See Cloncurry, 4 m.,
with ruins of ancient Ch.; also Donadea Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilcullen</span>, <span class="smcap">Old</span> and <span class="smcap">New</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Kildare, with
round tower, and remains of monastic buildings; bridge
over the Liffey. At Castle Martin, curious Chapel and
Mausoleum. Kilgowan, near it, has an ancient stone pillar
on a hill. At New Abbey, see the ruins and monuments
of the Eustace family. At Old Kilcullen examine the
shaft of an antique Cross covered with rude sculptures,
of which a good plate is given in Ledwich's Antiquities.
The style is grotesque, and evidently Danish. Some of
the figures are intended to represent priests engaged in
religious offices; but the others are mere caricatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kildare</span> is the county town, about 28 m. from the metropolis.&mdash;The
Abbey is a very fine ruin, consisting of part
of the tower and a considerable portion of the walls, containing
six Gothic arches and as many buttresses, but entirely
modernized. It is said that the ruinous state of the
steeple is in consequence of the siege during the civil war,
when its north side was knocked down by a Cromwellian
battery. The south wing is a mass of ruins, but the antiquary
may still notice two statues in alto relievo; one of
which is the representation clad in armour of an ancient
knight of the Fitzgerald family, surrounded by heraldic
escutcheons; the other a bishop with his pastoral staff, and
his mitre supported by monkeys. Close to the ruins is a
Round Tower 132 feet in height, with a light battlement
in pretty good preservation, being one of the best specimens
in the island. The monastic annals of this town present
the extraordinary instance of a <i>Sacred Fire</i> having
been preserved from the time of the Druids by Christian
nuns of St. Bridget; a lady much celebrated for her virtues
and her miracles. The place where this relic of heathen
superstition was preserved, is still in existence, and now
called the Fire-house. Of this fire many wonderful tales
are related, especially that although it consumed great
quantities of fuel, yet the ashes never increased. It was
considered impious to blow the fire with the human breath,
but only by a pair of bellows; yet people of plain sense
might suppose that a holy miraculous flame would never
require human assistance in any shape. It appears indeed
that in the 13th century the Archbishop of Dublin performed
a miracle in putting out this fire; but it was rekindled
and continued in good preservation until the dissolution
of the religious houses. The town stands pleasantly
on the side of a hill; and the ancient Castle is partly habitable.
The Curragh is a fine unequal down of short
pasture, famous for its races; and contains 3000 acres;
with remains of ancient Barrows or small Raths, which Sir
R. C. Hoare supposes to be Druidical. The hill of Allen
gives name to an extensive bog, and is celebrated for its
cave where repose the remains of Oscar and other Ossianic
chiefs, this being the hill of Temora in ancient times.
Dunmurry presents great variety to the mineralogist. Kilmaoge
has an ancient Ch. At Lackagh, 3 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, ancient
cemetery with ruins of Ch. and Castle. Monasterevan,
5 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, has a modern built Ch. and Nursery for the
Leinster Charter Schools: near it the venerable but beautifully
repaired mansion of Moore Abbey, seat of the Marquis
of Drogheda. At New Bridge, ruins of magnificent
Abbey of Great Connell. Rathangan, on the banks of the
canal, suffered greatly in the rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leixlip</span>, 8 m. from Dublin, near Lucan, a romantic
scene of wood, rocks, and water.&mdash;Near it, at Castletown, is
the finest house in Ireland, built by the late Mr. Conolly:
a large handsome edifice situated on an extensive lawn
surrounded by fine plantations, uniting with sombre
woods and artificial scenery. From hence visit also Cartown,
the picturesque seat of the Duke of Leinster; Summerhill;
Dangan, &amp;c. &amp;c. See also the Salmon leap, with
magnificent old Castle delightfully seated on a rising
ground overhanging the Liffey, near which is the celebrated
Aqueduct of the royal canal, being 85 feet above the
river, equal to the famous Roman work at Pont de Gard in
France. The village is picturesquely situated on the edge
of the river, near a charming wild romantic dell, where
high slopes covered with wood rise on each side above the
water, having paths that lead to the Cascade. See at St.
Woolstan's, 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, ruinous towers and gateways of ancient
Priory (1208).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maynooth</span>, 11 m. from Dublin, has lately become famous
for its Roman Catholic College, formed to receive a
great number of students. It has a large Inn and fine
Market-house; also a Protestant Charter School, and near
it are the ruins of an ancient Castle. Bishop's Court may be
visited along with the beauties of Leixlip: it is a magnificent
mansion and highly cultivated demesne of Lord Ponsonby.
Celbridge, a modern built village, is highly worth
notice, with fine stone bridge over the Liffey, and at the
lower extremity an elegant Ch. lately erected. See extensive
woollen manufactory; also at the <span class="smcap">S.</span> end of the village,
remains of a magnificent Abbey, now repaired, and
converted into a habitation presenting all the external appearance
of its former character, in all the gloomy grandeur
of Gothic architecture. Castle Browne, not far distant,
has recently been purchased for a society of Jesuits.
Furnace is a beautiful seat, lately much improved, with
ruins of ancient chapel in the lawn, in which is a window of
painted glass of high antiquity and extreme beauty. At
Oughterard, see ancient Ch. and Round Tower on summit
of a hill. Prosperous is another modern creation, being
founded by Colonel Brook in 1780, for a Cotton Manufactory:
&frac12; m. distant from which, at a place called the Cott, is
a strong sulphureous spa, richly impregnated also as a chalybeate,
useful in scrophulous and cutaneous diseases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Naas</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Kildare, was in ancient times the
residence of the Kings of Leinster, of which it still retains
evident marks in the existence of Moats or Raths of considerable
elevation at its <span class="smcap">N.</span> and <span class="smcap">S.</span> extremities. See Court
House; Parsonage House, built upon the site of an ancient
Castle; and extensive Barracks. No remains of its original
fortifications now exist; but the tourist will find a
good inn, with a supply of post horses. Jigginstown, &frac12; m.
distant, has been repeatedly noticed for the ruins of an
elegant mansion begun by Lord Strafford in the unhappy
reign of Charles I. It stands close to the road, and is
vaulted underneath. At Johnstown is the ancient mansion
and extensive demesne of Lord Mayo.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>MINERALS.</p>

<p>In the Red Hills on the southern limits of the bog of
Allen, the mineralogical tourist may derive great satisfaction
from an examination of the copper mines which were
opened there about 30 years ago. Dunmurry forms a kind
of headland to the north of the chain of hills, and the loose
stones on its surface frequently appear as if calcined in the
fire, of a red purple colour, and sometimes tinctured with
sulphur, generally considered as certain indications of the
existence of copper. Here shafts have been sunk to the
depth of 15 fathom in the solid rock, which is calcareous
in many places; and here is also found a white argillaceous
alkaline earth; together with calcareous spar, and
a fossil said to be a poor silver ore. On the conical hill of
Allen, about a mile distant, the vestiges of partial vitrification
are even more apparent, and many of the specimens are
richly impregnated with blue and green vitriol. Near Williamstown
the mineralogist may visit the deserted works of
a silver mine, and amuse himself with scientific research.</p>

<h2><a name="KILKENNY" id="KILKENNY">KILKENNY</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is an inland and not very extensive county; but is highly
worth visiting: for though much of it consists of furze-clad
mountains, yet these are finely contrasted by the diversified
scenery on the banks of the Suir and Barrow, its
eastern and western limits, and of the Nore which divides
it nearly in two. In several parts of the county the mineralogist
will find petrifactions or incrustations similar to
those of Derbyshire; especially on the banks of a stream
which flows through the glen of Ballyragget; and the Derbyshire
farmers may here learn a lesson from the Irish
agriculturists, who have discovered that these incrustations
or depositions, which form with great rapidity, make
an excellent manure. In many parts also are found calcareous
petrifactions of pectunculites, echinites, cochlites,
and some Cornua ammonis; and in several places, particularly
in the barony of Galmoy, (as stated by Mr. Wakefield,)
are tubiporites in such size and plenty as to be often
seen in the fields and on dry stone walls. The antiquities are
very numerous; Raths, Druidical Monuments, Castles,
Abbeys, &amp;c. are scattered in all parts, but very ruinous.
The rivers are on a large scale, and the scenery pleasing.

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Callen</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Kilkenny, has ruins of three Castles,
and old Gothic Ch., all destroyed by Cromwell. 1 m.
see Eve Castle in ruins; also very large Rath, 40 feet high,
46 yards by 24.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Comer</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Kilkenny; see the celebrated
Kilkenny coal-pits; beautiful mansion of Lady Ormond, the
scene of several battles during the rebellion. Town partly
burnt down, but since rebuilt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Durrow</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Kilkenny, a town pleasantly
situated on the banks of the Erkin, a small river, with
a good inn. Near it the large old-fashioned mansion of
Lord Ashbrooke. Roads good. Country round well cultivated,
with some wood. Several vestiges of Danish
Mounts. Visit Ballyspellan, 6 m. <i>S.W.</i>, a celebrated Spa,
chalybeate, with much to amuse the mineralogist; also
Druidical remains. Fertagh has curious old Ch., and
Round Tower 96 feet high. At Freshford see Irish inscription
over Ch. door. Galmoy has numerous Danish
Raths in its vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunmore Cave</span>, 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Kilkenny, is one of the
most remarkable in the island. Proceed to the Ch. of
Mothe, a little to the southward of which, in a field on the
slope of a gently rising hill, is the mouth of the cave, which
opens into a large oval pit, about 40 or 50 yards wide, apparently
formed by the sinking in of the surface, at the
eastern end. To this there is a descent of 70 feet from the
opposite quarter, over the rubbish of stone and clay; but
the other sides of the pit are perpendicular. Rabbits often
burrow near the entrance; and the first cavern, which is
spacious, but of an irregular form, is generally a shelter
for wild pigeons. To the roof of this cavern is an altitude
of at least 50 feet; the floor slopes downwards, and towards
the left the tourist arrives at a narrow passage which leads
by a slippery ascent to the interior cavern. The difficulty
of approach to this spot is amply repaid by the wonders
within, where a great variety of stalagmitic concretions,
added to the rugged forms of the rocks, exhibit a most
singular and striking appearance. The tourist who wishes
to explore all the wonders, must now proceed to the upper
end, which becomes much narrower, but soon expands into
a larger apartment. Beyond this there are other winding
passages and other caves; but as neither Mr. Wakefield
nor Mr. Walker seems to have explored them, it perhaps
remains for some adventurous tourist to discover wonders
equal to the caves of Trophonius or even Montesinos.
Those who choose not to proceed further may consult Mr.
Tighe's Survey of the County, where various other circumstances
are stated. It is said that one of those passages
leads to the other side of the hill, where day-light may be
seen to enter through a narrow chink. In another of the
inner caverns, imagination supposes the calcareous concretions
to have assumed the form of an organ; in another,
of a cross and altar. A stream of water passes through
the cavern at a considerable distance from its entrance;
and many skulls and other human bones have been found
near to it, also in the more interior passages beyond it.
Some of these skulls have been seen petrified, as it is
called, or covered with the calcareous spar. The mineralogist
may here pick up some specimens of an indurated
clay, tinted by carbon, and called in the vicinity black
chalk. Upon the whole, a visit to this place cannot fail to
be highly gratifying to the tourist; though he will meet
with some difficulties in exploring it, as the bottom is always
damp and slippery, and rugged withal, from the stalactites
formed by the dripping water on its very irregular
flooring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ennisteague</span>, or <span class="smcap">Innistiogue</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Kilkenny,
has a handsome Bridge and some pleasing scenery.&mdash;See
the enchanting and picturesque glen at Woodstock, near
Glanmore, with ruins of Ch. and Castle, in whose winding
recesses nature and art have done every thing possible to
embellish the scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gowran</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Kilkenny, stands on a pleasant
stream.&mdash;See Ch. in ruins, a fine specimen of the middle
Gothic. In the cemetery are the bones of the officers of
the Castle garrison shot by order of Cromwell for their
gallant defence. See Low Grange, 1 m., modern mansion
erected on ruins of ancient Castle. Visit Graignemanach
lying in a sequestered vale on the romantic banks of the
Barrow, which claims the tourist's notice by majestic ruins
of an extensive Abbey, of which the architecture and sculpture
excite our admiration even in its present dilapidated
state. It is built in the form of a cross; and its outline
pretty entire. The arch leading into the choir, rising to
the roof with double mouldings and supported by clustered
pillars, is a very fine specimen of the Gothic. It is impossible
to view the two plates of it given by Grose, without
wishing to explore its venerable arcades. It was a mitred
Abbey, and founded in 1212; but particularly remarkable
for having been the depository of a "Doomsday Book," or
Survey of the Island, begun by Henry II., and finished under
the orders of John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilkenny</span>, the county town, is 57 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dublin.&mdash;The
Castle is an interesting object to the inquisitive tourist,
originally begun in the 12th century by Strongbow, and
completed by William de Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke.
Great part of the ancient edifice has survived the various
convulsions of civil anarchy, now repaired and beautified
so as to form a conspicuous ornament to the city, on a
rising ground, with a rapid descent to the Nore, and on
the other sides fortified by walls and towers, the Gothic
grandeur of whose remains is disfigured in the eye of taste,
by a lofty marble entrance gate of the Corinthian order.
Much fine tapestry, in fresh and lively colours, representing
the story of Decius, will interest the visitor on entering
the breakfast-room. See also the alcove or presence-chamber,
hung with tapestry, with a chair of state raised a
step above the floor, a remnant of ancient pomp, now superseded
by the simpler habits of modern nobility. The
other parts of the mansion have also been well fitted up
for the fashionable conviviality which has recently graced
its walls. The ball-room or gallery is of great length, and
contains pictures, many of which are highly interesting,
being the portraits of the gay court of the 2d Charles. See
also the Countess's Dressing-room in an octagon tower;
the Chapel, and, if permitted, the Evidence Room, which
contains an immense mass of valuable MSS., materials
partially gleaned by Carte, the historian. Near the city is
the Cathedral Ch. of St. Canice, of considerable antiquity,
being, in its finished state, of the reign of Edward the 1st,
and still in very good preservation. It stands on an eminence,
with a descent on all sides; and the Ch. yard is
entered, from the town, by a flight of marble steps. The
cemetery being planted with trees has a romantic effect,
and presents a very extensive prospect over a rich vicinage.
In the interior the seats of the choir and gallery are of oak
varnished, and the whole plain, but remarkably neat. The
compass ceiling is adorned with fretwork, and has many
modillions, and in the centre a group of foliage, festoons,
and cherubim. In the nave and aisles are many beautiful
sepulchral Monuments. It is the Cathedral of the see of
Ossory; and close to it is a very curious Round Tower.
The Dominican or Black Abbey, an extensive ruin, with
the elegant ramifications of some of its Gothic windows in
pretty good preservation, stands low, and is surrounded by
squalid huts, which disfigure its outside and take off much
of the sombre effect of its venerable walls. The windows,
especially the east one, are light and elegant: the arcades
are open and airy; and the towers spring up with an airy
elegance that seizes at once upon the traveller's attention.
The Abbey of St. Francis, with its square Tower springing
from a lofty Gothic arch, is worthy the tourist's notice,
though much disfigured in its interior by the squalid cabins
of poverty and idleness, and by part of its precincts being
turned into a horse barrack. The great altar is a marble
slab of amazing size; but perhaps the most remarkable
circumstance about the place is the legendary story of a
sainted lady who built part of the choir, and whose extreme
chastity induced her to descend a virgin into the grave at
the age of 70, although she had been married young and
to several husbands. The ruins of St. John's Abbey, part
of which has been converted into a foot barrack, present
some very fine specimens of the light Gothic in the windows
and corridors. Founded in 1220. See the marble
mill, about 2 m. from the city, and on the left bank of the
river; a very ingenious invention, alike admirable for the
simplicity of its construction, and for the power which it
exerts. The saws are made of soft iron, and will last but
a week; each cutting about ten or twelve inches per day,
equal to the labour of two men. Not far from these mills
are various marble quarries; but the most curious mineralogical
specimen is called Sidero-calcite, so plentiful as to
have been used for repairing the roads. Unlike the other
marbles, it cannot be burnt into lime; but it contains a
quantity of iron and manganese; and as it is brittle and
friable, it has been proposed as an ingredient in mortar or
cement used for building under water. Visit Clogmanta
Hill, about 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, where are some extensive Druidical
remains, with a magnificent prospect from the summit.
Rathbeath, 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, is supposed to be the ancient Argat-Ross,
where in early times a silver mine existed, whence the first
Irish coinage took place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knoctopher</span>, 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Kilkenny, stands pleasantly on
the banks of a rivulet which flows into the Nore. Bessborough,
8 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, is a handsome seat of the Earl of that
name, in a park of 500 acres; the house 100 feet in length,
with elegant hall, saloon and parlour containing numerous
fine paintings, of the Italian and Flemish schools. See
various Cromlechs and other Druidical remains at Garryduff-hill,
especially Leibe ne Cuhn, or the Priest's Grave,
with stone cells. Grandison or Grany Castle, though apparently
not older than the reign of Henry VIII., being in
the style of domestic fortification of that period, and now
almost a total ruin, is yet far from being an uninteresting
object, not only in picturesque effect with its numerous
towers, but as affording a good idea of the insecure state
of society during that unsettled period. It has three
Round Towers on the Suir, and two Courts; a large square
Tower, connected to a great hall, and another Round
Tower form the other side; in the inside of the arch of a
window in the hall is a grotesque angel holding a shield
with the arms of Butler. It was built by Margaret, the
great Countess of Ormonde, at a period when ladies of
high birth seem to have been proud of exercising the masculine
authority of the other sex. Kells, a pleasant little
place, 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, has some pretty river scenery. At Kilbeacon
see Earl's Rath, a very large fort, oblong, and surrounded
by a deep fosse, formerly filled with water, with a
bank about 20 feet high; in the area are remains of buildings.
Kilmogue has a curious Cromlech, the upper stone,
45 feet in circumference, supported by several others, nine
in number. The stones are of siliceous breccia, and it is still
known by the name of Lachan Scahl, the Great Altar
Stone. At Mullinavat, the mineralogist will find considerable
amusement in his researches. At Tory-hill, to the
<span class="smcap">S.E.</span> about 7 m., and called in the Irish, Sleigh Grian, or
the Hill of the Sun, see a circular space on the very summit,
covered with stones, in which is one large squared
stone, 5 feet long, resting on three others, with an inscription
in the ancient Pelasgic characters, BELIDIVOSE,
supposed to be a dedication to the Deity, under the name
of Bel, Baal, or Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomastown</span>, 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> from Kilkenny, deserves the
notice of the antiquary from its being one of the most ancient
towns in the island, being founded by one of the
chiefs of Henry II. in his first expedition. From this Thomas
Fitz-Anthony it derives its nomenclature. Its principal
remnant of antiquity is the Abbey, of which there are
some considerable fragments; one end being fitted up as the
parish Ch. There is a venerable Tower at one angle; and
the Gothic arcades afford some fine specimens of the lancet
arch, evidently of a date posterior to the foundation of the
town itself. In the ruinous part of the edifice, the tourist
will notice a large sepulchral stone, which is reported in
traditionary legends to cover the body of a giant. Its trade
is considerably increasing in consequence of the river navigation.
The river Argula falls into the Nore, close by
Ballyduff, where are ruins of an old Castle. About 2 m.
above it, on the banks of the Nore, are the ruins of the
Abbey of Jerpoint, a Cistertian establishment as early as
1180. Its remains, which are extensive, more resemble a
fortress than an Abbey; and it has a very fine light and airy
Tower with four pinnacles. The picturesque tourist when
at this place must not omit a most romantic walk to a secluded
dell and glen at Kilfaun, about 1&frac12; m. in length, well
described by Wakefield, who notices an elegant cottage placed
in a situation truly delightful; opposite to which is a waterfall,
the rivulet running through the lawn and flower garden,
having on both sides rocks ornamented with large
evergreens, the whole scene exhibiting numerous beauties
both of art and nature. Near Thomastown is Mount
Juliet, the seat of the Earl of Carrick, which, though in a
neglected state as described by Mr. Wakefield, is deserving
of notice; the house being built in the old fashioned style of
architecture, and standing immediately on the banks of the
romantic and rapid Nore.</p></blockquote>

<p>MINERALOGY.</p>

<p>Granite in various parts of the county; particularly on
Brandon mountain near Gowran, with siliceous schistus,
containing mica, crystals, and jasper. Pyrites and quartz
near Inistioge. Black slate and hone-stones near Castle
Durrow. Kilkenny coal near Castle Comer. Some pieces
of very fine compact jasper, of various sizes, may be found
on the borders of the granite district in the <span class="smcap">S.</span> The specimens
already discovered were of a deep red colour, for the
most part obtusely angular, and squarer at one end than
the other: they were imbedded in yellow clay, a few feet
below the surface.</p>

<p>The mineralogist may feel gratified by the examination
of a very fine granite quarry in the vicinity of Gowran. It
is a beautiful stone of a light yellow cast, fine grained and
compact, and may be taken up in blocks of any required
size.</p>

<p>On the top of Drumdowny Hill, the extremity of an extensive
range, there is a dry stone wall inclosing a space
of about 300 acres, appropriated for quarrying a species of
breccia, or pudding stone, which is cut into mill-stones.</p>

with that river.&mdash;It is flat and often boggy, especially in
that district called the Bog of Allen; with the exception of
the range of hills that separate it from the Queen's County,

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballyboy</span>, 17 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Philipstown, is nearly central
to the county, on the Silver river, and but an inconsiderable
village, with ruins of several Castles in its vicinity.
See Anna lake and remains of Killinany Castle. At Ballycumber,
ruins of a Castle, and a Ch. At Ferbane, beyond
the Brosna, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, see ruins of Cool and Killcolgan
Castles; and near it are the ruins of Clonmacnoise, celebrated
as the cemetery of numerous chieftains, priests, &amp;c.
These splendid remains are seated in the midst of delightful
scenery, on a rising ground on the banks of the Shannon.
See an ornamented Cross, fifteen feet high, standing
near Teanpull Mac Diermid. It is in a rich style of sculpture,
exhibiting the duties of Christianity, and some legendary
stories of St. Kiaran, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 549,) the patron saint. The
doors of the Ch. of Teanpull are also deserving of notice
for their statues and ornamented architecture. Here are
also two stone Crosses, and another nearer to Ferban, with
ruins of several Castles. The episcopal palace is also in
ruins, about &frac12; m. distant, besides some remains of a Nunnery.
Many inscriptions in the Irish and the learned languages
may be traced in the sepulchral Monuments; and
the whole scene assimilates well with the wild and romantic
landscape that surrounds it. Frankford is a small
town, 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, with a Charter School, and some remains
of a roofless Chapel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banagher</span>, 30 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Philipstown, is seated on the
<span class="smcap">E.</span> bank of the Shannon, with pleasing river scenery and
two bridges: a well built town, and good station for the
tourist. Cloghan, 4 m., a village with a most comfortable
inn, rendering it a convenient resting-place for the pedestrian
artist wishing to examine the surrounding wild landscape.
The statist may also derive considerable pleasure
from investigating the progress of civilization and improvement
resulting from the judicious planting and cultivation
across the river Silver, by the Rev. Dr. Mullock, at Bellair,
and from the erection of a village well planned, with
neatness, cleanliness, and a good police as its main objects,
in concert with the introduction of the Linen Manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birr</span>, 28 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Philipstown, and seated on a river
of the same name, was formerly called <span class="smcap">Parsonstown</span>,
from the family to which it belongs, who have a castellated
mansion in the outskirts. The town itself is new, and well
built, of a good size, and the streets regularly laid out; with
a square, called Duke's Square, from a statue of the Duke
of Cumberland erected on a lofty stone column. The tourist
will find a good inn at the King's Arms. See the fine
old and venerable Castle, the mansion of the Earl of Ross,
which stood a siege by General Sarsfield in the war of the
Revolution. Excellent Market-house, and Infantry Barrack.
Canger, to the <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, towards the Sliebh-bloom
mountains, manifests how much may be done in Ireland by
the exertions of an individual. Here, by the judicious care
of Mr. Atkinson, aided indeed by the neighbouring gentlemen,
much has recently been accomplished; whiskey is
giving place to malt liquor; the people quiet and loyal,
though illiterate; and other improvements daily taking
place. Excellent houses are also building for the tenants;
labouring wages have been generously raised; the children
constantly employed, and industry and content going hand
in hand. Agricultural improvements and experiments are
here practised, to the manifest instruction of the hitherto
neglected farmer. At Drummoyle, 4 m., see the ancient
Castle of Leap, with the incongruous addition of two modern
wings to its Gothic centre. In the ancient part the
walls are 14 feet thick. Dunkerron has a comfortable inn
for those who wish to explore the southern angle of the
county, and the Sliebh-bloom mountains. Near it see Franfort,
the antique mansion of Mr. Rolleston, regularly defended
with fortifications, a fosse and draw-bridge; also a
modern, elegant, and spacious mansion house at Greenhills.
In the Sliebh-bloom mountains, see a large pyramid
of white stones, the emblem of the Sun-fire amongst
the Celtic nations, from whence arose their ancient name
of Bladhma, or Beal-di-mai, the necromancy of Baal's-day.
They extend through a range of 15 miles, through which
there is but one steep, narrow, and craggy pass, called
Glandine Gap, not more than five feet wide, called by some
the Irish Thermopyl&aelig;, and leading into Tipperary. At
Rathmore, or the Great Rock, examine that extensive
work once fortified by numerous towers, but now yielding
to the hand of peaceful improvement. Shinrone has a
handsome Ch., and Market-house, with a good Classical
School.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edenderry</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Philipstown, a pleasant village

<p><span class="smcap">Philipstown</span>, 39 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> from Dublin, took its name
from Philip of Spain, being in a new shire incorporated by
Queen Mary.&mdash;See ruins of Castle on bank of the river,
with the spacious Gaol,&mdash;this, though a sorry village, being
the county town. Near it see Croghan-hill, conical, and
beautifully clothed with the most luxuriant verdure to its
top; with ruins of Ch. at the base, and ancient cemetery at
the summit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portarlington</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, stands partly in this county,

<p><span class="smcap">Tullamore</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Philipstown, is divided in two
by the river Clodagh. Here the tourist will find a good
inn and accommodations at the Charleville Arms near the
bridge. The town was burnt down a few years ago, but is
reviving rapidly, with a busy and flourishing aspect, under
the auspices of Lord Charleville; intersected by a canal
leading from Dublin to the Shannon, on which a covered
boat is fitted for passengers. A short distance, and on the
banks of the canal, see a small square fortress in good preservation.
See Charleville Castle, a magnificent mansion
in all respects, erected in the Gothic style, but yet wanting
the hoary hand of time to darken its castellated battlements,
being built of limestone, which does not yet harmonize
with the foliage of a flat park, or with the artificial
piece of water formed in its front. The scenery in the demesne
is very fine, with cascades, grottoes, rustic bridges,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Clara, 10 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, is a neat handsome village, surrounded
by the Linen Manufactory. Geashill, 3 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>,
has ruins of an ancient lofty Castle, the residence of the
O'Molloys, which, defended by a lady, made a strong resistance
against Cromwell. Near it a celebrated spring, and
ruins of an Abbey.</p></blockquote>

his holy comrades had set up during the day. To check
the troublesome intruder, the Saint blessed some ropes and
drew them one night along the top of the building, when

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is amongst the largest of the Irish counties, extending
along the southern bank of the Shannon, and therefore,
though not maritime, yet enjoying, or capable of enjoying,
all the benefits of maritime intercourse. Those who are
merely in search of the wild and romantic, may perhaps be
disappointed by its scenery, as it cannot be esteemed
mountainous, except in the <span class="smcap">W.</span>; yet being diversified by
small hills, it might soon become highly picturesque if ornamental
cultivation were once to extend over its rich pasture
land, having no inclosures but rude earthen banks
almost entirely bare of foliage, and only diversified by the
squalid cabins of wretched cotters. On the borders of
Kerry there is a fine amphitheatre of low but steep hills
stretching in a curve from Drumcollogher to Loghil.
These hills give rise to the river Maigue, and several smaller
fertilizing streams, which traverse the county and fall into
the Shannon. The numerous Castles crowded together in
this county strongly mark its ancient feudal state. Bounded
<span class="smcap">N.</span> by the Shannon; <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> by Tipperary; <span class="smcap">S.</span> by Cork; <span class="smcap">W.</span>
by Kerry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Adare</span> is an ancient town, 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> from Limerick, on
the banks of the river Maigue, over which there is a good
bridge, close to the ruins of the Abbey, whose lofty tower
springs from a very curious arch, constructed with four
diagonal ogives meeting in the centre. The ruins are yet
in pretty good preservation, with beautiful Gothic cloisters,
ornamented with escutcheons of arms. The edifice,
being of limestone, has a curious yet venerable appearance.
See the picturesque ruins of an ancient Castle,
once the residence of the potent Earls of Desmond, and
often the scene of hostile conflict during the early times,
being often besieged and taken by the contending parties.
There are vestiges of several other religious edifices; but
the town itself is little more than a cluster of cabins,
through which the tourist passes in his way to Killarney.
In the vicinity is the demesne of the Quin family, beautifully
diversified with wood and water, whilst its lawns,
sloping down to both banks of the river, offer fine views of
the ivied Abbeys nodding their venerable heads over the
placid stream. Here too the tourist may wander delighted
in silent contemplation through the long-drawn vistas of
aged trees, and through shady walks, where once trod the
saints and heroes of ancient times. See Mount Shannon,
seat of Lord Clare, consisting of a large pile of building
ornamented with plantations, near which are seen the environs
of Limerick studded with neat houses belonging to
its wealthy merchants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Askeyton</span>, 16 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Limerick, pleasantly situated on
the Deel at its confluence with the Shannon; once fortified,
now decayed. See the Castle, or rather its ruins;
for of this ancient seat of the old Earls of Desmond, little
more than one side wall remains. It stood on an island
formed by the Deel river. The Hall, once the seat of hospitality,
stands upon arches which are still pretty entire,
but is now converted into a ball alley. Cross the river,
and at the distance of a few hundred yards see the ruins
of the Abbey, of which the cloisters still remain almost
entire. These are described by Mr. Wakefield as extremely
beautiful, being built of sculptured marble; and are perfect,
with the exception of two pillars carried away some years
ago by some person who considered them as holy reliques.
See Bally England Castle ruins; also Ballymort, the beautiful
seat of Mr. Massey; Courtferry Castle in ruins;
Court, seat of Sir H. Harstonge. Glynn, 8 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, near
Tarbert in Kerry, is a pleasant little village, seated at the
mouth of a small romantic bay, surrounded by hills and
high cliffs; with ruins of ancient Castle of the Knights of
Glynn. The village of New Bridge, near it, is interesting as
a colony of Palatines from Germany settled here by Lord
Southwell about a century ago. Mr. Young speaks highly
of their industry and cleanliness as superior to their Irish
neighbours. Near it, the seat of Mr. Bateman. Rathkeal
is a poor decayed village. See ruins of ancient Priory,
with curious figure of a monk in a window, painted like
Tom of Coventry. Extensive Barracks. Castle in ruins.
2 m. Shanagolden village in the vicinity affords shelter and
refreshment. See ruins of Loughgill Castle, on a pleasant
stream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilmallock</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Limerick, has by some been
styled the "Balbec of Ireland," and Sir R. C. Hoare recommends
it as an object highly worthy of the attention
both of the artist and antiquary; but he adds, that as the
former will find more than a day's work for his pencil, he
must take up his abode either at Bruff or Charleville, in
Cork, as the best accommodations at Kilmallock are but
indifferent. Sir R. also observes that the first view of this
place is singularly striking; with the appearance of a town
suddenly deserted and left in ruins. Enter by the side of
a lofty turreted gateway, leading into the principal street
formed by a double line of houses excellently well built of
stone, with a great uniformity in their style of architecture,
evidently of the time of Elizabeth; but many of these
are completely gutted, with nothing but the outward walls
remaining. Once there was a strong wall with five gates;
but only two remain. Parish Ch. in ruins, except the
Choir; of Gothic architecture. See Monuments of the
Vernons. Round Tower, and ruins of Friary. Visit St.
Patrick's Well in the vicinity. Bruff is little better than a
most miserable street of thatched hovels, with an indifferent
inn, but affording post-horses to the traveller. Near it
are a ruined Castle and Ch. The country flat and uninteresting.
See Galbally village, 9 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, where are fragments
of an extensive Monastery of Grey Friars, once
splendid and magnificent in religious pomp. Kilfinnan, 6 m.
<span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, has a Charter School, and ruins of an old Castle near it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Limerick</span>, 94 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dublin, is seated on the Shannon.
The Cathedral presents no very striking features
either in architectural or monumental antiquities; the only
piece of good old sculpture being the fragment of a monument
in the <span class="smcap">S.</span> aisle to the memory of the Galway family.
On the <span class="smcap">N.</span> side of the altar, the monument of the Thomonds.
See the fine view of the Shannon and surrounding
country from the ch. tower. Of the Castle, there are
considerable remains on the banks of the river; but so
blended with modern houses, as to produce no good effect
or subject for the pencil.  Public Edifices, Assembly
Rooms, and Theatre, elegant and commodious. Improvements
rapidly proceeding. Some remains of a Friary in
Tan-yard, and Barracks. Linen and Paper Manufactories.
See Thomond's bridge; Salmon-leap, 2 m. dist.; Marble and
blue limestone Quarries; Glove Manufactory; handsome
Custom-house; and Nunnery. Good hotel accommodations.
See in vicinity, at Buan-rath, ancient monastic

4 m. dist., stands proudly on a steep rock: its
majestic ruins manifest the dignity of the ancient Earls of
Desmond. Castle Connel, 6 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, boasts all the delights
of a fashionable watering-place, celebrated for its medicinal
water, and in the summer months much frequented
by people from every part of the country. Mr. Wakefield
describes it as a most beautiful village, deriving its name

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mountainous scenery of this county is described by
Mr. Wakefield as presenting neither roughness nor green
herbage, but exhibiting something between both, which
may be called uncultivated vegetation; while the lower
parts are inundated with water, and in some places have
been converted into bogs. The arable land is seldom
divided to any extent, and the scenery is little enriched by
the seats of the gentry or the elegancies of cultivation.
Limestone, both white and blue, is frequent in this county;
and the latter is often used in building, being not unlike
marble: yet it is sometimes found in so friable a state as
to be capable of being spread as manure without burning.
In a limestone rock on the coast, there is a remarkable
cavern, called the Robbers' Cave, which contains apartments
where a large banditti some years ago concealed
themselves, as a hoard for their booty, and were extremely
troublesome to the vicinage. There are numerous rivers.

Famous for fine linens. Extensive prospects from surrounding
hills. Ch. pleasantly situated. Old-fashioned house and
grounds of Jackson Hall; at Down Hill, seat of Sir Hervey
Bruce, some good paintings; waterfall near the entrance
of the grounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Londonderry</span> is a city 115 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Dublin, about
1 m. in circumference, which the tourist will visit with interest,
on account of its well known siege in 1690. Walk
round the walls; see the Cathedral, of some antiquity (1633),
the wooden bridge, 1/3 of a m. in length over a branch of
Loch-Foyle, serving also as an aqueduct. Town-hall and
Market-house; the Episcopal Palace, with the gardens
outside of the walls, from whence there is a fine prospect.
The view of the city from the bridge, with the shipping,
and backed by lofty hills, is worthy of notice. The view of this
town at the distance of a mile or two is most picturesque,
seeming to be built on an island of bold land rising from
the river, and backed by extensive hills. The philanthropic
tourist will not fail to visit the Infirmary, a handsome spacious
edifice under good regulations; also the Repository
for Work, and the Institution for small loans to the industrious
poor. (See Curwen, vol. i. p. 232, for rules and
regulations.) Good accommodations and post-horses. At
3 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>, see Aileach Neid, an ancient rath or castle of the
O'Neils, constructed like the Danish forts, and destroyed
by Murtogh O'Brian in 1101. Clady is a small village pleasantly
seated on the river Faughan, with ruins of O'Cane's

14 m. by 8, and forms a most commodious harbour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilrea</span>, 26 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Derry, on the borders of Antrim;

<p><span class="smcap">Magherafelt</span>, 30 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Derry, is a very neat village,
and forms a good station for the eastern district, and
for Lough-Neagh. Maghera is a small village, in an agreeable
neighbourhood. The tract of land on this side of Carntogher
Mountains, called the Braeface, exhibits some delightful
scenery. The cottages are built in tufts of hawthorn-trees,
the humble but happy abodes of an industrious
peasantry; deep glens, lined with bushes and shrubs, winding
from the higher parts of the mountain, mark the progress
of the winter floods, and terminate in the Moyola
which runs below. The Danish forts or raths are numerous;
and there is some curious antique sculpture over the
church door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newton Limavaddy</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Derry, is a neat

Lough appearing to great advantage, bounded by a bold
and precipitous hill towards the north; also a seat of the
Beresford family, with a fine approach through a wood of
stately oaks, and a rich underwood of holly. Accommodations
and roads good. At Dungiven, 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, see the

<p><span class="smcap">Granard</span>, 9 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Longford, is a neat town, consisting
of one handsome street about half a mile long, at the
head of which stands the Castle, built on a singular hill

<p><span class="smcap">Atherdee</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ardee</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dundalk. See the
Gaol, once an extensive fortress, gloomy and yet venerable.
Ch., a mass of ruins except the chapel; a high wall
encircles it, and its solemn appearance is much increased
by the lofty trees which shade the sepulchral heaps that
surround its mouldering walls. See Castle Guard, supposed
by some to have been a sepulchral monument,
perhaps a mote or meeting-place for the chiefs and people,
90 feet high, circumference at base 600, 140 at summit,
with remains of two concentric octagonal buildings: the
trench wide and deep, well planted. At Millextown, see
ancient Ch. with gable end at some distance, reported to
have been blown there in a gale of wind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlingford</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Dundalk, of great antiquity,
seated on a bay 3 m. in length, capable of receiving the
largest vessels; but yet so full of rocks as to be extremely
dangerous. But even these rocks are advantageous to the
epicurist, for here he will find the finest green-finned
oysters, long so celebrated among the lovers of good eating.
When first founded, it consisted entirely of castles, or fortified
mansions, erected for the protection of the English Pale
against the incursions of the unconquered northern Septs.
The principal Castle has been attributed to King John, or
perhaps to De Courcy; very well situated to defend a narrow
pass at the foot of the mountains close by the sea, where
only a few men can march abreast, as there are most dangerous
rocks washed by the sea on one side, whilst the other
consists of lofty mountains almost impassable. The Castle
itself is now a mere mass of ruins, triangular in its shape,
and seated on a solid rock, with walls 11 feet in thickness.
On the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side enough remains to mark the ancient apartments.
The view from it is extremely fine, with the ocean
on one side, and on the other the lofty mountains of Mourne,
which present a sublime spectacle. At the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of the
town are the picturesque ruins of an ancient Dominican
Abbey, founded by De Burgh, earl of Ulster, in the 14th
century. Of this abbey little remains but the Ch., whose
ivyed towers and battlemented walls present a very interesting
object, much heightened by the surrounding romantic
mountain scenery. See the lime-quarry, &frac14; m. distant, at
the foot of a high mountain, mixed with basaltes, crystallizations
of pyrites, shells, &amp;c. From the situation of the
town, the sun is lost several hours behind the hills after
sunrise and before sunset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Bellingham</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dundalk, is seated
on an extensive but shallow bay; pleasant village, with
good Inn. Good station for the sportsman, plenty of aquatic
wild fowl. See at Greenmount, curious earth-works on
summit of hill, with a tumulus: prospect extensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drogheda</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dundalk, (partly in Louth,
partly in Eastmeath, being divided by the Boyne) is
also a county of itself. Here are 9 Catholic chapels, 2 Friaries,
2 Nunneries, and 1 Ch. (St. Peter's) elegantly finished,
near which, in churchyard, see remains of ancient castle.
The view on approaching the town is beautiful; house of
the Catholic primate a striking object. Harbour good;
trade extensive; supply of fish excellent. See Tholsel, a
handsome edifice. St. Mary's, now a mere mass of ruins, with
the exception of a roofed chapel, which is used for divine
service; but it deserves notice for a lofty arch at the <span class="smcap">S.</span> end,
which marks the former splendour of the edifice. Bevrac
Mount, a large artificial tumulus, stands about 600 yards
distant. It appears to have been one of the large Raths
raised in ancient times. The town is interesting for the
part it bore in the Irish wars; and sustained a memorable
siege in Cromwell's time. Near it is a thin blue stone,
shaped like the bottom of a boat, on which many of the
Catholics believe St. Dennis sailed over to France. Ascend
the Boyne 2 m., and visit the field of battle where William
conquered, and where Schomberg fell, also Walker the patriotic
defender of Derry. The view of the scene from a
rising ground, looking down upon it, is extremely fine.
Mark the vale losing itself amidst bold acclivities; on the
right the Obelisk on a rising ground, a noble pillar and judiciously
placed. Let the tourist place himself at its foot,
and recall the events of past times! Then proceed further
9 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Drogheda, where is a beautiful wooded glen celebrated
as the route through which King William's army
marched to the ford in the Boyne water on the eventful
1st of July, 1690. The scenery around is highly interesting.
Collon village, 6 m. distant, must not be omitted by
the statistical tourist, as an instance of what can be done
in Ireland by modern improvement. The exertions of Mr.
Foster, in this place, have been well appreciated by Mr.
Wakefield, who describes it as delightfully situated amongst
hills, whilst the extensive plantations of its benevolent
founder are conspicuous in every direction for many miles.
Mr. W. adds, that this domain commands a prospect of singular
magnificence; the immediate foreground, looking
<span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, consists of a declivity of tilled land bordered on each
side by beautiful plantations; and the eye, then passing
over some miles of country, catches a view of Carlingford-bay,
forming a watery expanse of great extent, and of the
coast stretching to a considerable distance, with the mountains
surrounding the bay, and those of Mourne, still higher,
and which have a blacker appearance. The blue colour of
the bay, contrasted with the yellow tint of the sandy beach
by which it is bordered, the Carlingford mountains in the
vicinity, and the more elevated dusky ones of Mourne,
stretching inland in the form of an immense amphitheatre,
form, in Mr. W's opinion, a spectacle grand and magnificent.
The village, when he visited it, consisted of about
one hundred neat houses, all whitewashed; with a Ch. surrounded
by trees, and a river running through it, over
which there is a stone bridge; the whole much enlivened
by a bleaching-green on its banks. All this, together with
a cotton manufactory, has been the labour of 40 years. It
is highly worthy of notice, and is easily accessible by the
good roads in its vicinity. The botanist will receive much
pleasure from the inspection of the very fine collection of
indigenous and exotic shrubs which Mr. Foster has collected
round his comfortable mansion. See also <i>Curwen's
Letters</i>, vol. ii. p. 292. Observe the Ch. tower, of
chaste Gothic architecture; the curious winter garden.
In a romantic valley, 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> from Drogheda and about
1&frac12; m. from the banks of the Boyne, stand the once massy
but now dilapidated ruins of Mellifont Abbey, founded for
Cistertian monks, by O'Carrol prince of Uriel, in the 12th
century, and a spot of great interest in the history of the
English invasion of Ireland; for here died, and now lies
interred, Dervorgilla, daughter of O'Malaghlin, king of
Meath, a second Helen, who being married to Tigernach
O'Rourke prince of Brefinny, was basely ravished by Mac
Murrogh king of Leinster, who was in consequence forced
to fly from his dominions, and sought that succour from
Henry II. which led to the subjugation of the island. At
the Dissolution it was given to Sir Edward Moore, who
made it a castellated residence; but it afterwards became a
ruin, and within the last fifty years has suffered extremely.
<a name="Drog" id="Drog"></a>The most curious part is a remnant of an octagonal baptistery.
See <i>Hoare</i>, p. 242. Monasterboice, a village
about 3 m. from Drogheda, has a good specimen of the ancient
round towers, 110 feet in height and 51 in circumference,
with walls of the thickness of 3 feet 6 inches.
The door is at present only 6 feet from the ground; and it
appears to have contained six stories, from the stones that
project in the interior. The tower itself is built of a slaty
stone, frequent in the hills in the vicinity; but the door is
cased of freestone. Its summit is already in decay. Near
it are the ruins of two Chapels; also two very curious
crosses, the largest 18 feet in height, with a variety of
sculptures. A good view is given by Grose. See <i>Hoare</i>,
p. 237. Torfeckan village stands near the sea, and about
3&frac12; m. from Drogheda. It was once a place of some importance,
though now a paltry village, with nothing remarkable
but some towers of its ancient Castle, fast falling
into decay; and connected with some ruins of an Abbey
founded for nuns in the 12th century. Till within these few
years the Castle had been habitable, and was a frequent
residence of the Archbishops of Armagh, to which see it
belongs. See ruins of Glasspistol Castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dundalk</span>, 40 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Dublin, is one of the most ancient
towns in Ireland, claiming an early foundation from its bay
and harbour on the Irish Channel.&mdash;Being at the very extremity
of what was called the "English Pale," it often
became exposed to hostilities, and presented a mass of
castles and towers, for the purposes of defence, of which
some remains may still be traced. See the remains of an
ancient monastery for Crouched Friars, since turned into
an hospital: also some ruins of a house of Gray Friars, of
which a curious square tower still remains; the prospect
from its summit is rich and extensive. Notice the Market-house.
Inquire for Dundalk cambrics. See handsome
seat of Lord Roden, with curious antique portraits of Hen.
VIII. and Anne Bulleyn; spacious gardens; extensive well
wooded demesne. See Court-house, Gaol, Barracks, and
Charter School. Town irregular, yet neat; many of the
houses displaying considerable taste and elegance. About
a mile westward, on the summit of a hill, seen for several
miles along the great north road, and commanding a most
extensive prospect of the Mourne and Carlingford mountains,
are some remains of a fine old Danish station and
rath; a little below which, the tourist will notice the ruins
of an old Ch. or Chapel, enveloped in ivy, and pointing
out a Catholic cemetery of great sanctity. On the side of
the hill stands the Castle of Castletown, an ancient edifice
with towers and battlements, but partly repaired and habitable,
forming the offices to a more modern mansion close
to it. This castle was taken and sacked in the 14th century
by Edward Bruce; and there are some apparent vestiges
of those times in earth-works on the side of the hill,
towards the river. The village itself is small, and contains
nothing else deserving of notice. Balrichan is a peninsula,
about 2 m. from Dundalk, containing several curious antiquities;
some Druidical remains; ruins of a Castle with
subterraneous cave; the Giant's load, a massy stone 12
feet long, 6 feet square, resting on three uprights; Mount
Albani, an earthen camp, with a tumulus: also Castle
Rath, and the tower of Ballug. At Bellurgan, see the
park. Piedmont, a beautiful residence of Lord Clermont;
ruins of old Ch. and several Castles. Carrickasticken has
several raths, or sepulchral mounts. Fanghar, 2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span>,
has curious artificial mount, composed of stones and tarras,
60 feet high. At Killincool, on the Atherdee road, a fine
old Castle, with numerous vaults and secret passages.
Lurgan Green, a smart agreeable village; and a few miles
<span class="smcap">N.</span>, see the Jonesborough mountains, in all their native
wildness. Near them is Ravensdale, romantically seated
on the rise of a mountain, with fine hanging-woods on
every side. On the summit of a rocky hill, 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, curious
rath at Miltown; and, close to the frontier of the English
Pale,&mdash;in appearance and situation very much resembling
Bolsover Castle in England,&mdash;stand the majestic ruins of
Roche Castle, now in a state of demolition, the victim of
Cromwellian policy. It is well situated for defence; and
the builder having adopted the form of the precipice on
which it stands, for additional security, its form approaches
near to a semicircle in the interior, though on the outside
it more resembles a triangle. Its greatest length is 80
yards; its breadth at the broadest part is 40. At one
corner is a lofty tower, once august but now in ruins. The
view from it is not only extensive, but extremely fine.</p>

the capital of the Kings of Connaught; and stands in a romantic
situation between the Loughs Corrib and Mask.
It contains some ruins of an Abbey, which, in consequence
of its arches being partly semicircular and partly Gothic
or pointed, is supposed to be as early as the 12th century.
Long celebrated for its sanctity, it became for ages the sepulchral
dep&ocirc;t of the powerful and the holy, the chieftain
and the priest, whose dust lies mingled with its sombre
yet majestic ruins. Near it a broad river rushes at once
from beneath a sloping bank, and after a rapid course loses
itself in the Lough. This is supposed to be the outlet of
a subterraneous channel, through which the superfluous
waters of Lough Mask are discharged. The scenery

visit the Abbey of Urlare in a wild, romantic, secluded
district. The walls are still entire, and were never very
lofty; the eastern window is very fine, with the remains of
an altar beneath it. It was anciently a place of great sanctity;
and the sepulchral depository of the surrounding
chieftains. Archdall states, from tradition, that a town
once existed in its vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castlebar</span>, 119 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Dublin, is the county

Abbey has extensive remains, 5 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, a mass of ruins,
but still offering some very fine specimens of ancient ecclesiastical
architecture in its solemn Gothic arcades.
Grose has given a fine view of the interior of the Abbey,
which, he observes, was a noble structure, of excellent
workmanship, and the whole admirably finished. The
existing ruins are by no means equal to the original extent;
but much gratification will be afforded by the examination
of the chancel part, still in good preservation in
consequence of the roof remaining, with two Chapels on
each side into which the visitor is admitted through lofty
Gothic arches. The roof of the chancel is curious, its
groinings springing not from pillars, but from consoles in
the side-walls, highly ornamented with sculpture. The
great altar still remains under the east window, which consists
of three arches; and the altars yet exist in the smaller
chapels. See the noble arch, 45 feet in height, which
once supported the now fallen tower; also the principal
door, a pointed arch supported by pillars. In various parts
of the thick walls are doors and passages, speaking of secrecy
and seclusion, and dear to the lover of romance.
Croagh Patrick mountain, 2660 feet high, presents a fine
effect to the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> Foxford, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, is in decay, but

on Erew peninsula. Mount Nephin, a solitary mountain
2640 feet high, stands at the pass of Barnagee, with most
extensive prospect, about 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Castlebar. At Strade,
5 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, are some very solemn ruins of an ancient Dominican
Abbey of the 13th century, which contains some curious
specimens of antique tombs of the superior order of
Irish chieftains, adorned with figures in relief. See also
the Gothic ornaments of the high altar. Whilst in this
vicinity the antiquarian tourist will not neglect to visit the
round tower of Turlogh, 70 feet in height, 9 in internal
diameter, and having its entrance 29 feet from the ground.
It is built close to the Ch.; or rather the Ch. has been
erected so close to it as to touch it, and, though of more
modern structure, is now in ruins.</p>

ancient fortifications, with curious natural arch formed by
the waves on the rocky shore; several other caverns and
much romantic scenery in the vicinity. At Mullet in the
western district is much scenery worth seeing, also a very
ancient and curious monument in good preservation, called
by Governor Pownall, in the 7th vol. of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, a ship
Temple, upon the summit of a conical hill. The river Moy,
which divides this county from Sligo, has on its banks
three round towers, and ruins of several Abbeys. Moyne
Abbey, 2 m. distant, has most venerable ruins in a romantic
sequestered situation on the Moy. The ruins extensive
and in good preservation; scenery most picturesque.
3 m. distant are some curious remains of an ancient Franciscan
Monastery, called Rossarick. It is built of blueish
stone, with arches principally Gothic. The tower remains,
and has a confession-box of hewn stone with small oriels
or little ears on each side, through which the penitents
whispered their sorrows.</p>

Abbey Leix, the seat of Lord de Vesci, a considerable domain
covered with old timber, and intersected by the river
Nore, which, with the woods, forms its principal charm, as
the grounds are flat and unvaried. The statist will contemplate
with pleasure several neat villages in its immediate
vicinity, erected by the patronizing exertions of the
noble landlord. Aghaboe, near Abbey Leix, has remains
of ancient Abbey and Cathedral, of which little more than
the chancel now exists; remnants of Gothic architecture,
in the windows and various niches, canopies and concentric
mouldings which yet adorn its mouldering walls; but much
injured by a late rector. The Abbey of Aghamacart
lies to the <span class="smcap">S.</span> about 6 m. from Aghaboe, once very extensive,
and now in ruins. At a distance nothing appears but
the gloomy belfry; but the visitor soon arrives at an arch
of good workmanship which opens into the body of the
ruins, or rather into the remains of the chapel. There is,
indeed, little to attract attention, were it not for a legendary
tale, of a monk whose affection for a lovely nun was
met with such reciprocity on the part of the lady, that
gossip scandal would soon have spread her thousand wings.
To expiate his crime and escape reproach, the monk flung
himself from the battlements of a tower and perished; but
the fate of the unhappy fair is wrapped up in oblivion.
Aghamacart Castle, now forming a total yet picturesque
ruin, is not of earlier date than the reign of Elizabeth.
Ballinakill, 9 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, ruins of Castle, demolished by Cromwell.
About 15 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, on a small point of land watered by
the Barrow, stand the very picturesque ruins of Cloghgrennan
Castle, deeply embosomed in foliage and entwined with
ivy. About 4 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> is Dunamase, a hill fort, which, though
almost in total ruins, affords to the antiquary and to the
man of taste a very good specimen of the military manners
of earlier times. Though standing on an insulated rock,
its name signifies the "Fort of the Plain." This rock is inaccessible
on all sides except the east, which, in its perfect
state, was defended by the Barbican, of which a considerable
part remains. Here began the principal defences,
with ditches on each side, until stopped by rocks, where
walls seem to have been erected, with two towers for the
protection of the Barbican, from whence the visitor enters
the Ballium or Bailey, the gate of which is 7 feet wide,
with walls six feet in thickness, and the remains of a parapet
crenelled and embattled. This leads to the upper
Ballium, the gate of which is in a tower, from whence
fragments of walls extend on both sides; here too was the
keep, with a sally-port and prison. This fortress belonged
to Dermod McMurrough, King of Leinster; but the present
remains are rather of later date; perhaps the work of
the Pembroke family in the 13th century. It is now repairing
by Sir H. Parnell, with judicious attention to its gothic
grandeur. Doonaun, a village about 16 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, has extensive
coalpits, which claim the notice of the mineralogist by
rocks of whinstone resting on a stratum or column of basaltes,
40 feet below the surface; below which are strata
of slate and iron ore. Great Heath, or Rathean Common,
2 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Maryborough, is memorable for a battle in the
3d century between the people of Munster and Leinster;
and the bones of the slain are often dug up at the present
day. Killone Hill is conical, with curious cavern and subterranean
lake, highly worth the tourist's notice. Near it
a fine quarry of calcareous stone equal to Portland. The
Maragah, or Margy Mountains in the <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> present a fine
field for the geologist. About 1&frac12; m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Dunamase, the
tourist will descry a small fortress, called Shean Castle,
standing on the summit of one of the high, steep, conical
hills, so frequent in this part of the county. It is still habitable,
though its surrounding defences have been long in
ruins, demolished in the Civil wars. Stradbally, 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>,
neat village, handsome Ch., good Market-house, and
Charter School. See Brockly Park, the magnificent seat
of Earl Roden; and Stradbally Hall, that of Mr. Crosbie:
about 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> is Dun-cliun-poic, or Dun of Clipoke, an insulated
rock with curious caves; near it is a tombstone with
Druidic inscription. About 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> from Stradbally, stands
the Castle of Timahoe, an edifice not older than the reign
of Elizabeth, but now completely in ruins, having stood a
siege in the civil wars, at which time it was dilapidated.
Its area is now filled with cabins of the peasantry: there is
nothing very interesting to the tourist; but close to it
there is one of the ancient round towers, now fast mouldering
away. The entrance is at a height of fourteen feet
from the ground, and is ornamented with a chevron or
zigzag moulding, a circumstance which opens a wide field
of conjecture as to date and origin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountmellick</span>, 6 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Maryborough, is a pretty
little village, perfectly in unison with its inhabitants who

Dawson's Grove, residence of Lord Portarlington.
Near this town, see Lea Castle, famous in the wars of the
13th century, and standing on a rising ground. This edifice
manifests the strength that was given to these dens;
for its walls are 8 feet thick in some places, in others 10.
It was 60 feet long, 46 feet broad; its arches all circular
except one pointed one. The river Barrow secured one side,
and filled the ditches of the other; so that it was only approachable
by a narrow causeway 100 feet in length, a
good defence before the introduction of artillery. See
ruins of Morit Castle near Emo, in a wild valley, intersected
by a rivulet.</p></blockquote>

especially the effect of the tower, covered with thick foliage,
and springing from great arches which were 45 feet
in height before the ravages of time had spread the floor
with the relics of the mouldering walls. The interior has
once been very fine; solid walls fill up the spaces between
the pillars, supposed to have been erected in the reign of
Elizabeth, when this dissolved monastery was turned into
a fortified post, for which it was certainly well fitted, and
actually stood a siege from the Earl of Tyrone in 1595.
The east window, when in its glory, must have been extremely
beautiful. Near to the Abbey are some vestiges
of one of the round towers; and every thing around it would
tend to produce a most impressive scene, were it not that
the cloisters have been long occupied as a barrack: yet the
silence and gloom of the interior, with the solemn arcades,
and the emblems of mortality that lay scattered over its
surface, will not fail to gratify the contemplative visitor.
Cambo Castle is about 2 m. distant. About 7 m. from
Boyle, and upon the edge of a very extensive bog, are the
ruins of the Abbey of Clonshanville, now almost a total
ruin. Of the cloisters no remnant exists; but the tower,
60 feet high, forms a pleasing object, with the few Gothic
fragments at its base. Croghan is immortalized as the residence
of Cathmor, the friend of strangers: here is an ancient
Rath, also a sacred Cave of the Druids, and near to it
Relig-na-Riagh, or the resting-place of the Kings of Connaught,
an immense cemetery in a circle 200 feet diameter.
Visit French Park. See Kingston Hall, an elegant mansion
of Lord Lorton. Lough Arrow, 3 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Boyle, is
beautifully studded with wooded islands: also Lough Gara
to the <span class="smcap">W.</span> Lough Glinn is also in this vicinity; on its banks
stands a noble mansion of Viscount Dillon, with some extensive
grounds, of modern erection and improvement; and
on the opposite shore the tourist may visit two ruinous
towers, which are all that remain of a once very extensive
antique fortress, a feudal residence of the old barons of
Ophaley. One of these towers has long been used as a
temporary prison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athlone</span>, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Roscommon, is principally in
Westmeath, where it will be described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elphin</span>, 13 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Roscommon, though an episcopal
see, is only a small neat village, celebrated as the birth-place
of Oliver Goldsmith. See the magnificent palace;
also the Diocesan school-house. Ballintobber was the residence
of O'Connor, king of Connaught, but now a dilapidated
village. Here are some very extensive ruins of the
ancient Castle, built round a square, flanked by four towers
of different forms. The vestiges are in a most dilapidated
state, but possess some further interest from an anecdote
recorded by Grose of a young Irish <i>Gentleman</i>, during the
civil wars, who behaved with the most devoted bravery in
an action fought close to the walls. When victory declared
for the Parliamentary forces, this youth, disdaining to fly
with his party, placed himself at the corner of a ditch,
where he defended himself with his pike against five horsemen
who fired on him, when a gigantic English soldier,
getting behind him, slew him. Being stripped and his cap
taken off, long tresses of flaxen hair fell down, which exciting
further curiosity, it was at length discovered that
this unhappy youth was a female. See Lough Kee, a romantic
lake, adorned with finely wooded rising grounds; on
a peninsula are the very picturesque ruins of St. John's
Castle. In the Lough is an island called <i>MacDermot's</i>,
after a chieftain of that name, stated by tradition to have
been of a very jealous disposition, and to have confined his
wife in it, whenever he was engaged in any of the warlike
contests of those turbulent times. If the legends, however,
are to be credited, the lady certainly gave him sufficient
cause for his jealousy; and all his precautions were
unavailing: for it is said that her lover used to swim to his
nocturnal visits as Leander did to Hero. The obstacles he
had to surmount were indeed numerous; for the island is
surrounded by a wall close to the water's edge, encircling
a gloomy tower now overgrown with ivy. At present the
interior is filled with trees, and the island presents a picturesque
and singular appearance. On another island are
the ruins of a religious edifice, supposed to be founded by
the Culdees, and now called Ennismacreeny Abbey. The
walls of the Ch. are yet standing, solemn and sombre, the
windows being only long loop-holes; at some distance is a
little dark Chapel, which sufficiently marks the gloomy seclusion
of those superstitious times. Round Tower at
Oran. Strokestown is a neat village; near it the magnificent
mansion of Ross Mahon, Esq. Visit Tulsk, a mere
hamlet, but worth notice for its antiquities. Here are some
remains of an ancient Abbey, little known, and supposed
to have belonged to the Dominican order. Nothing exists
now but some bare walls, marking the site of the Ch., and
part of a square tower; but it seems never to have been
very lofty nor very extensive. Near it is Tormonia, the
ancient residence of O'Connor, of whose Castle there are
some remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roscommon</span>, 70 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Dublin, is the assize town.&mdash;Ancient
Castle stood several sieges in Elizabeth's reign
and in the Civil wars; now an extensive mass of ruins. See
the once august ruins of the ancient Abbey, founded by
Cathal Crowdeargh O'Connor, king of Connaught, in the
13th century, whose tomb may be traced in its solemn
aisle. Little remains except some shattered windows and
ruined arcades. Near to the modern mansion of Castle
Coote are some remains of the old Castle, erected by Sir
Charles Coote in the reign of James the First. It stood two
sieges during the Civil wars, but is at present a mere mass
of ruins; forming, however, a picturesque object in the demesne.
See elegant mansion at Castlereagh; and a curious
battlemented house, called Donamon Castle, may be
visited from Roscommon. Its appearance is extremely
whimsical, being square with projecting turrets at the angles.
A lofty range of stone steps leads up to a circular
doorway, nearly as high as the roof; and within is a similar
range leading to the upper apartments. It is in good
repair and habitable. In front is the river Suck. About
7 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Roscommon, the tourist may visit the picturesque
but not very lofty or extensive ruins of the Abbey of
Clonthuskart, in such a state of dilapidation that little more
can be accurately traced than the principal chapel, the
eastern window of which must once have been extremely
grand. Kilmaine is the demesne of the Crofton family,
within whose bounds is the hill of Kilmaine, on the summit
of which is a small ancient Ch., partly in ruins. The place is
solemn and fitted for meditation, were not the visitor's attention
completely engaged by the very extensive prospect
which bursts upon him over no less than sixteen counties.</p></blockquote>

for the examination of the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> district; or the tourist
may apply at Tobercorry, a few miles distant. 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of
it, on the river Moy, are the very picturesque and ivied
ruins of Bennada Friary, whose lofty square tower, 70 feet
high, forms a very striking object, starting from the thick
foliage with which it is surrounded, on a rising bank amidst
a range of meadows. Whilst in this vicinity, the tourist
will be gratified by a ramble to the ruins of Court Abbey
close to a small village of that name, and about 3 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>
from Achonry. The way to it is not very agreeable, being
mostly through bogs: it is, however, an object not easily
missed, as it stands conspicuously in a small field, where its
lofty tower, fifty-three feet high, frowns over the ruins below.
The interior sombre and solemn; used as an open
cemetery. Proceeding a little further, the visitor arrives,
through a lofty Gothic arch, at a Chapel the windows
of which were once ornamented with paintings, now
obliterated. Here are also several pedestals for the statues
of saints, but now untenanted; in the south wall are some
slight remains of a window once rich in tracery. Passing
into the western Chapel, observe a curious octagonal inverted
cone, supposed to have been the receptacle for the
holy water; and on the northern side of the chancel are
melancholy memorials of mortality, the recesses in the
walls being entirely filled with human skulls: the whole
presenting a scene of desolation perfectly in unison with
the wildness of the surrounding country. Not far from the
village of Tubbercorry are some remains of an old Castle
of the O'Hara. The country around is flat and boggy, and
there is nothing to repay the labour of a visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ballinafadd</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> of Sligo, is a small village,
but will afford shelter to the tourist who wishes to examine
its vicinity. See the ruins of ancient Castle, picturesque

with thick walls, circular tower, and most extensive prospects
over the Curlew mountains, along Lough Arrow;
and along a wild but romantic valley to the <span class="smcap">S.</span> Ballymote,
5 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>, has a Castle which presents a good specimen of
ancient military architecture at the commencement of the
14th century, when erected by Richard de Burgo, the red
Earl of Ulster, a man of high power and possessions. The
ruins are still very extensive, and seem almost to bid
defiance to time. Six round towers, one of which is 53 feet
in height, flanked the walls that were 9 feet in thickness,
with a gallery or covered way of communication all round.
At the end of the town are some remains of the ancient
Ch., with some finely pointed Gothic arches, and curious
east window. Franciscan Friary. Somewhere in this vicinity
is Corren, with curious caves called the Giant's House,
with an approach cut in the rock, steep and difficult. Lough
Arrow, already noticed under Roscommon, presents much
romantic scenery. On its banks, in a wild open district,
stood a Convent of Dominican nuns (1427) in honour of
the Virgin. At present little remains except the Ch., called
Ballindown Abbey, in sufficient preservation to show its
ancient form, though unroofed. It consists principally of
two Chapels united by a belfry, with this curious architectural
whim, that the east and west windows only are Gothic,
but all the others elliptical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enniscrowen</span>, or <span class="smcap">Eniscrone</span>, about 28 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Sligo,
may be visited by those who venture to explore the wild
recesses of the barony of Tyreragh. Castle Connor, near
to it, has curious caves, lined and roofed with great stones,
on a hill, as yet scarcely noticed by the antiquary. Close to
the sea stand the remains of the ancient Castle of Roslee,
sombre and solitary. Little more now exists than one
lofty tower, in the thickness of whose walls is a curious
staircase leading to the gloomy apartments within. The
Castle was originally of considerable extent, and near it
runs a rivulet, traditionally said to have once been fitted
with a weir for the purpose of catching salmon; the fish,
by an ingenious contrivance, ringing a bell as soon as
caught, and thereby giving notice to the cook of their capture.
At Screen, 15 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, see Danish-Stone Rath on a hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sligo</span>, 104 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Dublin, stands upon a river, by
which the waters of Lough Gilly are discharged into a large
bay, and which admits vessels of 200 tons up to its quay.
See Court-House, Gaol, Barrack, Infirmary, and Charter
School; Custom House and quays; much trade; good accommodations.
Close to the town, and pleasantly seated
on the river Gilly, near its confluence with the sea, stand
the ruins of the ancient Abbey, of early foundation, but
burnt down in the 15th century, and immediately afterwards
rebuilt in a very superior style of sculpture and architecture.
It has two large chapels divided by a square
belfry, the tower of which is entire except the battlements,
and resting on a lofty Gothic arch. The other arches of
the Gothic colonnades are lofty, and enriched with foliage
and angels. The Ch. is completely uncovered; three sides
of the cloisters have an arched roof in pretty good preservation:
their arches are semicircular; but a profusion of
Gothic ornament exists in other parts of the edifice. The
front and sides of the altar are ornamented with Gothic
arches, foliage, and tracery; and there still remain pedestals
for statues, whose sanctity could not work miracles
against Time. The tourist must not neglect to notice the
eastern window, which is very beautiful. Around the nave
is a stone gallery; and at a height of several feet from the
ground may still be seen the tomb of O'Connor, lord of
Sligo, his figure and that of his lady kneeling on each side
of an altar. Taking a ramble about 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> from the town,
the tourist will see, at the foot of a small hill, the neat village
and Abbey of Ballysadere, erected about the 12th
century for Augustine monks. At present nothing can be
traced but the arches of the belfry and a small part of the
tower, built of black stone: not far distant are the picturesque
remains of an ancient Chapel, with windows of cut
stone, and some curious carved heads on the doorway.
Visit Nymphsfield near Ballysadere, where there is a waterfall
worth sketching. The Giant's Grave, or Lugne
Clogh consists of several stones resembling Stonehenge.
Innismurry is an island of the north coast, with curious
subterraneous cells: also interesting to the sportsman.
Lough Gilly abounding with romantic scenery; about 5 m.
long, and 2 broad. Its greatest charm is Hazelwood, the
beautiful seat of Mr. Wynn, at the end of a wooded peninsula
which runs out into the water, and is seen to most
advantage from the lake. On the opposite side of the lake,
contrasting finely with the lawns and artificial arrangements
of Hazelwood, is seen a range of rude mountains,
partially planted and cultivated; beyond which is another
range in fine retiring distance. In the island of Innismore
are ruins of an old Ch. of the Culdees, covered with ivy,
and marked by numerous superstitions. Knocknaree is a
mountain of considerable altitude and extensive base, in a
wide field of desolation. Malachwee hill has a curiously
fantastic appearance, with extensive prospect. See Mercury,

along its <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> boundary. It presents all the varieties of
rude, uncultivated, mountainous districts, and of fertile
plains, on a substratum of limestone, equalling any part of

one of the highest mountains in Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="Cashel" id="Cashel"></a><span class="smcap">Cashel</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Clonmel, affords much research
for the antiquary, as it seems to have been dedicated, from
the earliest times, both to religious and civil purposes: for
here was a pagan temple, and here the monarchs of
Munster were crowned, seated on a lofty stone. See modern
Cathedral of handsome Grecian architecture; Episcopal
Palace; Market House; Sessions House; Charter
School. Examine ruins of old Cathedral seated on the rock
of Cashel, particularly Cormac's Chapel, of which the inside
length, says Ledwich, is 47 feet; the breadth 18; the
height of the roof 54. This Chapel has a chancel and
nave; and on square pillars, adorned with a lozenge net
work, rest round columns as on their pedestals, from which
spring the arches. These columns are short and thick,
and have bases, tores, capitals, and entablatures, rudely
executed: the portal is semicircular, with nail-headed and
chevron mouldings; the windows are half circles also.
Notice a crypt 53 feet long, and eighteen broad within
divided into a nave and choir, the crypt itself being
arched and supported by short and massy columns. A
figure of an archer mounted on some ideal quadruped
is placed over one of the doors, and the canonized bones
of Cormac are supposed to lie under the altar. In the body
of the cathedral, and on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of the choir, is a lofty
monument of the 16th century, of Milar Magrath, Archbishop
of Cashel, with an epitaph written by himself. The
approach to the cathedral is very fine. See lofty gate and
western tower; chapel dedicated to the Apostles, and curious
subterranean passage supposed to lead to Hore Abbey;
steeple rising from four fine arches; ornaments round
the windows. In the town, inquire for the remains of
Franciscan Abbey, at the back of Friar-street; also of a
Dominican Friary. Near the rock, on a flat amidst some
rich scenery, are the ruins of Hore Abbey, of early erection.
Its remains are still very fine; but when sketched
by Grose, they were indeed noble, with a lofty tower 20 feet
square, resting on two fine arches, 30 feet in height. The
nave was 60 feet in length, with gothic arcades and lateral
aisles; and there may still be traced a small low arched
room, evidently a confessional, as it contains niches in the
walls with holes for the penitents to speak through. About
3 m. from this city, see the ruins of Athassel Abbey, of
the order of St. Augustine, founded by William Fitz Adhelm
in 1200: one of the noblest religious structures
erected by the early English invaders. These ruins are
still very extensive, and present a good idea of Monkish
times and manners: the choir, in particular, seems to have
been of great magnitude and splendour, 44 feet by 26; and
the nave nearly of the same dimensions; the whole having
been 117 feet in length. See a curious small chapel in the
<span class="smcap">S.W.</span> corner; also the cloisters which were extensive; the
steeple, square and lofty; and in short, the whole mass of
arches, walls, windows, monuments, &amp;c. A good engraving
of it is given in Ledwich's Antiquities. Emly,
about 14 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, on the borders of a lake, with ruins of Ch.,
a large stone cross, and holy well. In this district the picturesque
tourist may visit the Galtees, a range of mountains
with sides nearly perpendicular, and highly romantic.
Golden, a small village, forms a station for several curiosities,
with ruins of a Castle, on the river Suir. Sir R. C.
Hoare says, "that a round tower, with the river, bridge,
&amp;c., form a good subject for the pencil." The accommodations
are good, at the Castle Inn. Visit Thomastown, the
demesne of Lord Landaff; an ancient mansion; also Suir
Castle, residence of Lord Massy. At Shrone Hill, a large
unfinished house of Lord Milton's. Tipperary contains
merely one long street, but gives name to the county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clonmell</span>, 82 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dublin, is the county town,
and stands pleasantly on the river Suir, with good trade
and a woollen manufacture. Accommodations good. See
Market-house; Court-house; gothic Ch.; modernized Barrack,
and Bridge of 20 arches. Few remnants of antiquity,
having suffered much from Cromwell. Memorable as the
birth-place of the facetious Sterne. Examine Medicinal
Well for scorbutic diseases. Ardfinnan is an ancient village
7 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> from Clonmell, existing previous to the
first English invasion, and seated on the river Suir, over
which there is a long bridge of 14 arches. The town itself
stands low, but close to it is a high rock, bold and picturesque,
overlooking the river, selected by King John as
a fit situation for an extensive castle, which suffered much
from the cannon of the Parliament army in the Civil Wars,
yet still presents a very picturesque specimen of military
antiquity. It is square, with two lofty towers overlooking
the town, and a high ascent to it on all sides, and at a
distance seems perfect, as the greatest part of the walls
and the principal gate are yet standing; but the inside is a
total ruin, no roof remaining except over one apartment.
Cahir, 5 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> from Clonmell, stands upon both sides
of the Suir, surrounded by the extensive domain of Lord
Cahir, which Mr. Wakefield describes as bearing evident
marks of the good effects that may be produced by the patriotic
exertions of an ardent mind directed to laudable pursuits,
and anxious for improvements, contributing particularly
by extensive plantations to increase the beauty of the
county, which, in this vicinity, naturally abounds with wild
and romantic scenery. See the remains of the old Castle,
also the ruins of a very large building at Somerstown, near
to Cahir. The ride from Cahir to Clogheen is described by
Mr. Wakefield as being an object of research to the inquisitive
tourist. He says "that proceeding through a
valley which extends from the Galtees, the traveller finds
himself between that range on the <span class="smcap">N.</span>, and the Knockmeledown
mountains on the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, wild also in the extreme, the
whole district being divided into fields, either by grassy
dykes or rough stone walls." The latter mountains are exceedingly
barren. They are covered solely with heath,
which in the spring season is extremely black; and as
their great height, at the time when Mr. Wakefield visited
this dreary vale, completely intercepted the rays of the sun
which lay hid behind them, every thing assumed a dusky
appearance, which threw a gloom over the whole visible
face of nature. Clogheen is situated upon a stream close
to the bottom of these mountains, and the road to it forms
a gradual descent of nearly two miles, with a lofty black
mountain in front. It is a considerable thoroughfare, and has
good accommodations for the tourist either of picturesque
or mineralogical research. Ascend a long and lofty mountain
about 2&frac12; m. to Baylough in a hollow, with a fine echo
either from a bugle-horn or even a musquet. The view towards
Clonmell very beautiful. At Kilshielan, see ancient
tumulus, called a Fairy hillock. Knocklofty, residence of
Lord Donoughmore; good house and grounds.</p>

<p><a name="Fethard" id="Fethard"></a><span class="smcap">Fethard</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Clonmell, is in a decayed state,
but affords accommodation for the eastern district. See
remains of ancient walls; and some ruins of monastery.
At Kilcooly is a very fine Ch., in excellent preservation,
once belonging to a Cistertian Abbey. It is still roofed and
entire, with gothic windows of rich tracery, and a handsome
square tower, whose light battlements are luxuriantly
enveloped in ivy. At Killenaule, see ruins of several
old Castles, in the midst of rich scenery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nenagh</span>, 30 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Clonmell, is a good station for
the northern district. The approach is thus described by
Sir R. C. Hoare, who says, "that leaving Birr, he entered
the county of Tipperary, passing through a village
with mills, and a small Castle; another ruined fort on the
left; corn lands; a Castle in ruins on the right; a line of
road as straight as if it had been planned by a Roman engineer;
an extensive plain, with distant hills; bog; a slight
ascent; a large bog on the right; a Ch. rebuilt, with the
ruins of the more ancient one annexed. Corn pastures,
and bog; road rough in parts; a gentleman's seat on the
right; more wood; another seat on the right; the country
improves; plain, bounded by some high hills." After this
<i>flying</i> picture, the tourist may alight at the New Inn, where
he will find good accommodations. The town itself is large
and regularly built, with the remains of a Castle, having a
circular tower of strong masonry. The antiquary may trace
the ruins of an Augustine Friary. In 1370, the English
forces were defeated near this town, a small party having
assisted Turloch O'Brian, by Brian, nephew of Turloch,
who thence assumed his surname. See ruins of Knockalton
Castle, 2 m. also Lough Derg, formed by the river Shannon,
with fine scenery and antiquities, further noticed in
Clare and Galway. Silver mines, so called from some virgin
silver having been discovered in the lead ore: see
Dunalty Castle. Toomavara, a small village, has ruins of
a Preceptory of Knights Templars; also Blane and Knockane
Castles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninemile House</span>, that distance <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Clonmell, is
merely a travelling stage, but forms a good station for much
wild mountain scenery in the Sleivh na Manna range.
Near it the ruins of an old Castle, with the handsome residence
and well planted grounds at Kilcash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roscrea</span>, 30 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Clonmell, stands on the very
verge of the county, and is a thriving and wealthy town,
on the post road from Dublin to Limerick, standing in a
fertile and populous district. At the entrance of the town
the tourist will notice the very curious architectural decorations
of the Ch., with its Saxon doors and niches, its
sepulchral crosses; and lofty round tower, 80 feet in height
and 15 feet in diameter, possessing also the singularity of
a window with a pointed arch at the height of 30 feet from
the ground. The Castle (1213) is now a barrack. Monaincha,
about 3 m. from Roscrea, and about 1 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> from
the road leading to Burros in Ossory, cannot fail to be
highly interesting to the antiquary as the birth-place of
the long celebrated monastic order of the Culdees, a Christian
but not Roman Catholic sect, that commenced in the
6th century, according to Ledwich, in this remote corner
of the world, in a little island in the midst of a bog, sometimes
called Innisnabeo, or the "Island of the living." Columba
was their founder, as may be seen at large in <i>Ledwich's
Antiquities of Ireland</i>, p. 56; and it is a curious
fact at the present moment, that so adverse were the Culdees
to the tenets and practice of the Church of Rome, as
to draw down the wrath of the Vatican, and the festival of
St. Columba was forbidden in the other parts of Ireland.
The bog in which these ruins are now to be seen was formerly
a lake: for Giraldus Cambrensis describes it as such
in 1185, with two islands, one containing a Ch. and the
other a Chapel; a fact that must render a visit interesting
to the geologist. The geologist who directs his research to
the bog of Allen will naturally visit this bog of Monela,
which is but a continuation of it; and here he will not fail
to notice the extraordinary fact, that what was the lesser
is now become the greater isle. The easternmost of the
two is the largest, and contains about 2 acres; in it stands
the Culdean Abbey, of which considerable vestiges still
remain. The tourist will particularly observe the arch of
the choir, which is semicircular or Saxon, and on which
sculpture seems to have exhausted her treasures: a nebule
moulding adorns the outward semicircle of the portal, a
double nebule with beads the second, a chevron the third,
interspersed with the triangular frette, roses and other ornaments.
It is also decorated with chalices, artfully made
at every section of the stone, so as to conceal the joints.
Here the ruins afford some research for the mineralogist,
as part of the stones used are of a whitish grit, brought
from the neighbouring hills of Ballaghmore, but being
porous they have suffered much from the weather; whilst
the columns of the choir are of a harder texture, close-grained,
reddish in colour, and once highly polished. These
have evidently been quarried on the <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> side of the bog,
and are a species of schistus, splitting into lamin&aelig; of six
feet long, with which most of the abbey is cased without.
Notwithstanding this, some ashen keys having in past
ages been dropped on the walls and insinuated into the
interstices, they have now become large trees, and add
much to the solemnity and singularity of the place: unfortunately,
the action of the roots on the walls threatens a
speedy ruin to great part of this venerable edifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thurles</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Clonmell, is not only a place of
considerable inland trade, but has long been a favourite
residence of the Catholic primates of Munster, who carefully
preserve various relics of St. Cormac. Here are the
ruins of an ancient Castle, built upon a very extensive plan
by the first Earl of Ormond in the 14th century. It surrounds
a large area, and is flanked by several towers both round
and square, with a lofty semicircular gateway. Like many
other castles in this part of the country, it is a monument
of the ravages of the Parliamentary forces during the civil
wars. See ruins of St. Mary's Ch., built in 15th century,
now falling rapidly into dilapidation; neat modern Ch.;
good Market-house; Barrack, formerly a mansion of the
Llandaff family; tower and some portion of an ancient Ch.
of a Carmelite monastery. About 2 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> on the banks
of the Suir are the very extensive remains of the Cistertian
Abbey of the Holy Cross, founded before the 12th
century by Donogh king of Limerick, and long esteemed
as a spot of the greatest sanctity; and even in latter days
considered as a very fine specimen of sacerdotal architecture.
The Steeple, or Square Tower, is lofty, and attracts
the eye at first approach: it is supported by a lofty Gothic
arch, and its workmanship is highly finished. The body of
the Ch. consists of a nave and aisles, not very profuse in
decoration; but the chapels have been highly ornamented.
The effect on entering the nave is very impressive, being a
noble expanse of 58 feet by 49, with an arcade of 4 arches
on each side opening into the lateral aisles. Passing through
the choir, and turning to the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, the visitor discovers two
small chapels, each about 10 feet square, and between
which is a double range of Gothic arches, supported by
twisted pillars, a spot supposed to be so holy that the monks
were always waked there previous to interment. Two other
chapels are seen on the north side; and in the eastern
chapel, already noticed, there is a very curious Gothic tomb,
without inscription, but said by tradition to be the sepulchre
of a "good woman," who brought many holy relics to the
abbey. Longford Pass, a small village on the road into
Kilkenny, has ruins of several old Castles in its vicinity;
also Newark Park. At Temple More, a neat and well built
village, see handsome Ch. and spire; elegant mansion of
the Carden family, and a romantic seat and demesne belonging
to the Marquis of Lansdown; with numerous vestiges
of ancient Castles.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="WATERFORD" id="WATERFORD">WATERFORD</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Scarcely</span> equals half the extent of some of the larger counties.
It is bounded on the <span class="smcap">N.</span> by the Suir, on the <span class="smcap">W.</span> by the
Blackwater, and on the <span class="smcap">E.</span> and <span class="smcap">S.</span> by the ocean. Mr. Wakefield
observes, "that two such noble estuaries as the Suir
and Blackwater are seldom seen, abounding with magnificent
and romantic scenery, combining with lofty mountainous
tracts."</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dungarvon</span>, 21 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Waterford, is one of the
greatest fishing-towns in Ireland, being situated near the
Nymph Bank; but Mr. Curwen complains heavily of the
bad accommodations which he met with: the town small;
the streets narrow: yet persons returning from the lakes
will do well to take this place in their route. Crossing the
Ferry at Youghall, and passing through an uncultivated
tract of mountain scenery, destitute of inhabitants, but
highly susceptible of improvement, the tourist approaches
this town, built on the beach, and appearing, from the descent
of the mountain, as if it stood in the sea. Dungarvon
itself will not detain him long. See Barrack on site of an
ancient Castle; also ruins of Augustine Abbey of Gothic
architecture; lofty steeple springing from a curious vault;
ancient monument (1400). In the summer much company
will be met with as a bathing-place. If the tourist is hurried,
and without time to examine the whole county, he
may take an interesting ride across it towards Clonmell.
Leave Dungarvon, cross a valley of excellent land about
4 m. wide; turn round a projecting chain of mountains,
and then see the small village of Kilmacthomas, from which
village the first few miles exhibit the same face of country,
till within a short distance of the banks of the Suir, where
the eye is once more gratified with the appearance of trees.
On the right, for nearly the whole of the way, there are
magnificent views of the ocean, but not a gentleman's seat
is to be seen in the whole distance between Youghall and
Lord Waterford's seat at Curraghmore. Ardmore, 8 m.
<span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Dungarvon, stands near the sea; a poor village,
once episcopal. Examine ruins of two Ch. with curious
sculpture; round tower, 100 feet high, 15 in diameter; St.
Declan's dormitory in cemetery; St. Declan's stone, that
swam from Rome to bring home his belt and vestments:
Danish Raths. Dromana, the splendid mansion and demesne
of Lord Grandison Duck's-pool, 1 m., ruins of
Abbey. Kilmacthomas, 9 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span>, pleasing village, with
good river scenery and fishing, and some remains of Castle.
Whitchurch, 5 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, has curious cave called Con-a-glour,
or the Pigeon-hole, 150 feet long, with subterraneous
river, fantastical crystallizations, &amp;c., from whence (or
Lismore) the tourist may visit Oonamort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lismore</span>, 30 m. from Waterford, and now a scene of desolation,
formerly an university, bishop's see, and a city!
Here is a handsome stone bridge of twelve arches, erected
across the river by the munificence of the Devonshire family,
to whom the castle and estate belong; the castle now
undergoing a complete repair. On the approach towards
the town of Lismore the road falls into a beautiful glen
which proceeds in a winding direction; whilst the sides of
the mountains by which it is formed, are clothed with a profusion
of oak and ash. A stream of considerable size, which
discharges itself into the Blackwater at the town, runs through
the glen, and adds considerably to its beauties. This fine scenery
lasts for about two miles. Near the town are the remains
of the immense Castle once the residence of the
brave but unfortunate Sir Walter Raleigh. It is an interesting
object, and appears once to have been a place of
some strength, boldly situated on the verge of a rocky hill,
rising almost perpendicularly to a considerable height over
the river Blackwater, upon which the principal window of
the great room of the Castle looks down, and from whence,
it is said, James II. started back with horror. This
Castle is of very high antiquity, having been built by
King John upon the ruins of the Abbey of St. Carthagh.
Dr. Smith, speaking of the view from the great window of
the Castle, observes, that "opposite to it there opens a wide
glen wooded on both sides, and pleasantly watered by a
small river which, at the distance of a mile, winds off to
the west side of the great mountain of Knock-mill-down,
4 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> from it, and which exactly facing this window
appears like a vast cone or sugar-loaf. To the west is a
full prospect of the salmon-fishery, where the weirs are of
a considerable length, traversing the river,&mdash;the working
and the noise of the water through them (that here runs
pretty rapid) forms a kind of artificial cataract, and resembles
the sound of such, which, though not high, is of a
considerable extent, and adds a lulling softness to the
beauty of the scene. Above the weirs, the sides of the
river are beautifully variegated with woods, lawns, and
cornfields." See the old Cathedral fitted up as a modern
Ch. See view from the noble bridge, particularly pointed
out by Mr. Curwen, exhibiting the majestic rock on which
the Castle stands, the valley on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of the river,
which, though confined, is extremely luxuriant, and the
hills rising boldly on the northern bank towards Cappoquin.
Sir R. C. Hoare observes, that though the scenery on the
Blackwater cannot be compared with that on the Wye, the
Dart, or the Tamar, in England, yet he is inclined to think
it cannot, for the long continuance of 20 m., be surpassed or
even rivalled by any other stream in Ireland. It affords
some good subjects, he adds, for the portfolio; of which the
most striking and best adapted to the pencil are those at
Balinatry, Strancally, and Dromana; but all must yield to
Lismore. The tourist will find a good inn and a good salmon
fishery. Aglish, 4 m. <span class="smcap">S.E.</span>, is near Dromana, already
noticed under Dungarvon. See ruins of ancient Castle;
also ruins of venerable Abbey, 1 m. Cappoquin, 2 m.
across the Blackwater, has a wooden bridge and ruins of
ancient Castle, with a most enchanting and extensive prospect.
Curwen describes it as a small neat town, with several
handsome seats ornamented with timber and very
picturesque scenery in its vicinity. Sir R. C. Hoare recommends
to notice Dromana House, rising perpendicularly
from a rock completely covered with trees; the character
of that bend of the river being richness, with cultivated
lands decked with trees, and distant mountains: also
Turin, a modern house on an old Castle, seat of Mr. Kane,
a finely wooded dingle in front backed with lofty mountains;
ruined Ch. on the left; flat islands planted with willows;
quarries of limestone, one fine mass of which bounds
the river on the left. Modeligo, 7 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span>, has ancient Castles
of the Magraths. Oon a mort is a small cave, similar
to that of Con-a-glour. Strancally is 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> towards the
mouth of the river, with ancient Castle and curious cave,
respecting which there are some horrid legends: and near
it the handsome seat of Headborough, with venerable ruins
of Molana Abbey. Tallagh, 6 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, is a poor decayed
village, with Lessfinny Castle near to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waterford</span>, 75 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dublin, is episcopal and collegiate.&mdash;From
Carrick-on-Suir to this place the road passes
through a district which exhibits a great variety of picturesque
views along the banks of that river. From the nature
of the situation, the city itself is not seen until the
traveller is within a short distance of it, standing apparently
in the bottom of a basin, with the Suir, about a mile
broad and crowded with shipping, flowing close to its side.
See the noble quay, about 1 m. in length, with a wooden
bridge which has a drawbridge in the centre, adding much
to the beauty and convenience of the city. Elegant modern
Cathedral. Handsome episcopal Palace. 3 Parish
Ch. 4 Catholic Chapels. Court-House, erected on Black-friars
Monastery. Tholsel. Gaol. Custom-House. Exchange.
Coffee-Rooms. Assembly Rooms, and Theatre.
Remains of Franciscan Friary. The earliest remnant of
antiquity to be seen here, is a circular tower situated in
the eastern angle of the city walls, said to be the work of a
Danish chieftain in 1003, and (after him) called Reginald's
Tower. The bridge is constructed of American oak. It
is 832 feet long, 42 broad, has two sets of piers, each of
seven pieces, besides cut-waters. The longest pile driven
was 70 feet; the depth at low water is 37 feet, and the rise
of the highest tides is 17 feet. Here is an existing Catholic
Monastery. See the Woollen and Glass Manufactories;
also Clonegan Tower, 72 feet high, erected by the late
Marquis of Waterford to the memory of his son. Carrickbeg,
12 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span>, opposite to Carrick-on-Suir, has ruins of
Franciscan Friary, with a leaning steeple. Whilst in this
vicinity the tourist will be gratified by a ride over the large
demesne of Curraghmore, which in many parts commands
the most extensive prospects of the surrounding country.
Mr. Wakefield notices that from the tower the eye can
trace the Suir the whole way to Waterford, while the
ocean, stretched out along the coast on the <span class="smcap">S.</span>, forms in the
remote part of the picture a very fine object. The house
is seen to most advantage in front, as it is backed by wood
which exhibits very grand scenery. There are some good
paintings. The demesne is stated by Mr. W. to contain
2800 acres, of which nearly one half is covered with wood.
The whole of this extended property is surrounded by
walls; and it excels in mountain scenery and woody wildness.
Kilmanahan Castle, a mansion recently erected on
the site of an ancient Castle, and preserving the old style
of architecture, which gives it a very venerable appearance,
rising from the summit of a rock at a bending of the Suir,
which here divides the two counties. This position gives
it the advantage of a very extensive prospect; and Mr.
Wakefield declares that grandeur, united with elegance,
renders this one of the completest residences that he had
ever seen. Here too the Suir runs with great rapidity, and
is seen rolling his waters beneath well wooded banks, with
the Galtees mountains in the distance. Visit Kilmeaden
Castle, Ch. and Spa. Passage is the place of embarkation
for the Milford Haven packets, with ruins of Ch. and most
extensive prospect from Faithleag-hill. Good inns. Tramore,
6 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, is an excellent bathing-place; delightful village,
with neat Assembly Room and all the usual accommodations.</p></blockquote>

and nearly in the centre of Ireland. In the town there
is a strong Castle defended by numerous guns. See the
pontoon or floating bridge, consisting of between 30 and
40 boats. Examine chalybeate spa. Many beautiful prospects
between this and Ballymenach. Inquire for ruins
of Monastery at Drumrany, or Drumrath; also at Kilkenny
West, a small village. At Maghretibot, or the Field of
Theobald, see the field of battle where Sir Theobald de
Verdon fell in a contest with the Irish clans. Moatagrenoge,

Ch. of Clonarney, and that of Archerstown, near a new-built
seat of Mr. Battersby; also a seat of Mr. Smith. Between
Archerstown and Fore, Sir R. C. Hoare notices a tumulus
which appears to be sepulchral, surrounded by a fosse, but
not so exactly executed as those on Salisbury Plain. But
Fore also interests by its own ruins of parish churches, walls,
and gateways, with the shell of a spacious Monastery seated
in the vale below, dedicated to St. Fechin, first built in
630, and re-founded in 1209. Sir R. G. Hoare states that
this Monastery presents a large pile of simple and unornamented
masonry; the Chapel is still in a tolerable state of
preservation, and has three narrow pointed windows.
Lough Lane (already mentioned) a large piece of water with
three wooded islands upon it: it produces good trout and
pike. The scenery is not very romantic, for the banks are
flat, but well cultivated. On its <span class="smcap">N.</span> side the waters penetrate
under the rock, and reappear on the opposite side
of a hill near Fore, where they turn a mill. To the <span class="smcap">S.</span> of
the lake, at a short distance, is a raised earthen work, commonly
called the "Fort of Turgesius," a chieftain of great
military renown with the old historians. He lived in the
ninth century. If any reliance can be placed upon topographical
derivations, this vicinity must once have had a
very literary character; for <i>Foure</i> signifies the <i>town of
books</i>, and <i>Lough Lane</i>, the <i>lake of learning</i>! This lake gives
birth to two rivulets, which discharge themselves into the
sea on opposite sides of the island. There are fine rides
through the well cultivated country in its vicinity, especially
in the road to Rochford, commanding in succession a view
of a pleasing lake, Lough Derrin; the "Crooked Wood,"
a hill so distinguished for its foliage, though now denuded;
and the beautiful wooded hill of Knockdrin. See Castle
Pollard, and Pakenham Hall; also Loughs Armagh and
Drin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilbeggan</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Mullingar, is a pleasant village,
with good river scenery in the Brosne. Some remains of
Monastery. The artist may here find amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinnegad</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">E.</span> of Mullingar, is a mere village, but
has excellent accommodations for the wanderer. On a hill
near to it see ruins of Ardmullan Castle; also Kilbride
Pass, where are ruins of ancient Ch. and two Castles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mullingar</span>, 34 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Dublin, is the shire-town, with
good accommodations. Some ruins of a Dominican friary;
also Baronston, the seat of Lord Sunderlin, may be visited
from this place. See beautiful Ch. recently erected. The
statistical tourist will do well to consult <i>Curwen's Letters</i>,
vol. ii. p. 249. Inquire for Horse-leap, 6 or 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span>, where
are some remains of a very stately Castle built by Sir Hugh
de Lacy, one of the earliest English adventurers; and
another 2 m. distant. To the <span class="smcap">N.</span> inquire for the beautiful
demesne and elegant mansion of the Nugents, with remains
of a venerable Castle in vicinity. To see Lough
Derryveragh in perfection, go to Wilson's Hospital, delightfully
situated between that and Lough O'Whel, or
Hoyle. From the Hospital notice charming view of Lord
De Blaquiere's residence and the romantic lake scenery,
with a prospect over five counties. The Hospital is supposed
to be in the centre of Ireland; its revenues are large.
About 2 m. from Mullingar, from an eminence, there is a
most extensive prospect of Lough O'Whel and Lough
Ennel, looking towards Belvidere, which has the celebrity
of being one of the most enchanting spots in the island.
Lough Ennel lies between Mullingar and Kilbeggan, and
is pretty extensive, its eastern banks decorated by many
gentlemen's seats. Near this is the late Lord Belvidere's
seat, at Belvidere, perched on the crown of a beautiful little
hill, half surrounded with others, variegated, and melting
into one another. Lough Ennel, many miles in length and
two or three broad, flows beneath the windows, spotted
with islets, whilst a promontory of rock fringed with trees
starts into it; the whole bounded by distant hills. "Greater
and more magnificent scenes are often met with, but no
where a more beautiful or a more singular one." Multifarnam
possesses the magnificent ruins of an Abbey of
Franciscans, highly interesting for its connection with a
most important period of Irish history. When the monasteries
were dissolved, this abbey was given to an alderman
of Dublin, one of whose successors permitted the friars
to assemble here again, with a splendour nearly equal to
their former state, having their organ and choristers in the
Ch., with fine apartments for themselves, barracks for
soldiers, and a large establishment for the reception of
those who chose here to seek for shelter; and it is asserted
that within the walls of Multifarnam was first concerted
that rebellion which broke out in massacre in 1641. Enough
remains to gratify the lover of ancient architecture, in its
pointed gables, Gothic windows, and lofty tower 60 feet
in height, and in its solemn cloisters which may still be
traced. New-Pass, not far distant, is a pleasant mansion
with good lake scenery. See Tyril's-Pass, a neat village
with ancient Castle ruins.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Presents</span> many interesting considerations to the English
tourist, arising from its being the first active scene of invasion
by the Anglo-Norman adventurers in the reign of
Henry the Second. It is, however, a district very little noticed
by casual travellers, who, perhaps from its apparent
deficiency in mountain scenery, rashly pass it over <i>en route</i>,
reserving all their admiration and praise for the more classical
beauties of Killarney. Yet Wexford well merits investigation,
not only for the magnificent and romantic views
at every turn of the Slaney, one of the most beautiful rivers
of the island, which divides it nearly in equal parts,
but also for the immense number of Gothic castellated ruins
which yet adorn its green eminences, the relics of feudal
barbarism and of intestine hostility. Add to this, much of
it is in a high state of cultivation; especially the baronies
of Bargie and Forth, which yet are completely denuded of
all kinds of timber. Bounded <span class="smcap">N.</span> by Wicklow; <span class="smcap">E.</span> by Irish
Channel; <span class="smcap">S.</span> by Atlantic Ocean; <span class="smcap">W.</span> by Waterford, Kilkenny,
and Carlow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bannow</span>, 11 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Wexford, may be visited along
with Feathard and Clonmines. Here Strongbow landed,
temp. Hen. II. Those fond of aquatic sports may visit the
Saltees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clonmines</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Wexford.&mdash;In his excursions
on the banks of the romantic Barrow, the tourist will not
omit to visit the ruins of the once very extensive Abbey,
with its light, lofty pinnacled tower, ivied walls, and elegantly
ramified western window, formed of red grit, but
completely whitened by the moss which enwraps it. Some
fine specimens of ornamental sculpture are to be found in
the architecture of the western door and in the arches of
the cloisters, also on a monument within the Ch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clonegall</span>, 21 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Wexford, is a small village:
but here the tourist may commence his examination of the
river Slaney. Visit Newtonbarry, the seat of Col. Barry,
deriving great animation from the picturesque effect of
river scenery combined with modern improvement, and the
majestic range of Mount Leinster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enniscorthy</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Wexford, stands agreeably
on the Slaney. Ancient Castle fitted up as military dep&ocirc;t.
Handsome bridge, six arches. Close to it is Vinegar Hill!
A few miles to the <span class="smcap">E.</span> is Courtown, remarkable for its evergreens,
which grow to an immense size with a marine
aspect. Near this also are the pleasing seats of Kyle and
Bellevue, places of extraordinary beauty, and affirmed by
Mr. Wakefield to be inferior to none in the British empire,
abounding in magnificent scenery, richly planted, undulating
and varied in their surfaces, and animated by the
Slaney flowing between them, which often assumes all the
grandeur of an expansive lake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fethard</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Wexford.&mdash;Ancient Castle, once
in ruins, lately altered and modernized. Principal tower is
an elegant specimen of the ancient military architecture,
with its crown and battlements supported by brackets or
consoles, and fantastic embrasures from whence the enemy
could be annoyed in the old system of defence. Visit Dunbrody
Abbey, on the Barrow; ruins magnificent; fine
sculpture in <span class="smcap">W.</span> window. Several ruins of Castles and Danish
raths. Duncannon Fort is a good specimen of modern
fortification, though of early foundation, having been erected
for the defence of the river against the threatened attacks
of the Spanish Armada, in the reign of Elizabeth. It stands
on the flat surface of a lofty rock which overlooks the bay
forming the entrance of the river. See the Hook Tower.
At a distance of about 3 m. from the fort stands one of the
most noble religious ruins in the island, Tintern Abbey, in
consequence of its first monks being brought from that
abbey in Monmouthshire by the founder, William earl of
Pembroke, whose piety was prompted to a vow during a
threatened shipwreck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ferns</span>, 13 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Wexford.&mdash;On an eminence in the
town see the ruins of the ancient Castle, one of whose fine
circular towers is almost entire, containing amongst other
apartments a beautiful chapel, the groining of which
springs from consoles in the wall, but the flooring is gone.
Over it is an arched room with embrasures or loop-holes.
See ruins of Abbey; elegant Episcopal Palace; modernized
Cathedral, with ancient tomb of St. Meoloch. Camolin is
the seat of Earl Mountnorris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gorey</span>, 21 m. <span class="smcap">N.E.</span> of Wexford, exhibits the effects of
rebellion in the destruction of several elegant seats in its
vicinity. Here were horrible scenes of massacre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ross</span>, or <span class="smcap">New Ross</span>, 15 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Wexford, stands amidst
fine scenery on the Barrow, opposite to the junction of the
Nore. Several ruins of religious houses, and an existing
monastery. Elegant wooden bridge. Fine view from the
hill. In the Ch. of St. Saviour, see a curious monument,
of as early a date as the commencement of the 14th century,
but falsely attributed by tradition to a lady of the
name of Rose Macrae, who is called sister to Strongbow,
an anachronism which confutes itself. The female figure
lies on the monument, with the hair reticulated round the
forehead; and on the breast is a solitaire, from which a curious
ornament hangs pendant. Here was fought one of
the bloodiest battles in the late rebellion. (See <i>Hall's Tour</i>,
vol. i. 98, for many curious particulars.) Near it is Scullabogue,
where near 200 protestants were burnt to ashes in
a barn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wexford</span>, 67 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dublin, a very ancient town.
Vestiges of walls. See elegant modern Ch.; Court-house;
wooden Bridge 2100 feet long, where 97 protestants were
butchered in the rebellion. Trade and manufacture considerable.
Small obelisk, to the memory of Major Vallotton.
See some ruins of the Ch. and Abbey of Selksar, or the
Priory of St. Peter and St. Paul, supposed to have been
founded by the Danes. The antiquary will not fail to visit
the majestic ruins of the Ch. of St. Mary, of which Grose
has given a good plate, representing it as small but of excellent
workmanship; being remarkable for its elegant
arches supported by round columns, the cases and capitals
of which are of peculiar construction. The shafts of the
pillars are of hewn stone; but the remainder of the ruin
consists of plain walls and unornamented windows.
Amongst the sepulchral monuments which remain, there is
a tomb with some sculptures, and a female figure recumbent,
but for whom it is unknown. The choir is entered
by a circular arch, the others are Gothic. To enjoy a very
fine prospect go to Ferry Carrick, where the stream becomes
contracted between considerable rocks. Here the
tourist ought to land, and ascend the rising ground on the
west side of this narrow pass. An inland bay, which appears
unexpectedly, and animates the scene in no common
degree, then opens to the view. This noble expanse of
water is bounded by steep banks, all cultivated, and in some
places covered with timber. To the <span class="smcap">E.</span> the distant mountains,
which are softened into the purple of distance, add
much to the effect of the surrounding scenery, which, indeed,
abounds with uncommon beauties. Immediately beneath
is seen a handsome wooden bridge, painted white,
which makes a very pretty object in this natural picture,
still further diversified by the ruins of an old Castle on an
opposite rock; a situation that seems to bespeak a sense
of taste, as well as a sense of danger in the steel-clad
chieftain who once frowned within its sombre walls.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="WICKLOW" id="WICKLOW">WICKLOW</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Is one of the best known in the island for its beauties, on
account of its vicinity to the capital, combining within itself
all the rudeness of uncultivated nature, the romantic
effect of wood and glen, the sublimity of mountain outline,
and the charms of extended ocean. It must be confessed
that the interior offers little beyond the variations of mountain
and bog; but the sea-coast is rich in the splendour of
marine villas and the busy neatness of crowded watering-places,
presenting a variety of the most beautiful scenery,
which would afford delightful occupation to the painter, the
poet, or the tourist, fond of delineating nature as it appears,
unassisted by the artificial aid of man. It is true
that there are no navigable rivers, but it possesses abundance
of smaller streams, which running down from the
mountains with great rapidity, discharge their waters into
the Irish Channel. Noblemen's and gentlemen's seats are
numerous; as those fond of rural retreats are attracted
hither by the vicinity of the capital, and by the romantic
beauties which abound almost every where, as well as by
the uncommon mildness of the climate, which is peculiarly
remarkable for the luxuriance of its foliage in evergreens,
myrtles, laurels, arbutuses, &amp;c. The larch is a favourite in
all modern plantations; and the oak flourishes in the rocky
glens. Bounded <span class="smcap">N.</span> by Dublin; <span class="smcap">E.</span> by Irish Channel; <span class="smcap">S.</span> by
Wexford; <span class="smcap">W.</span> by Carlow and Kildare.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Arklow</span>, 10 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Wicklow.&mdash;See Bridge of 19 arches
over the Avoca; modern Ch.; Barracks in commanding
situation; ruins of Castle, an old Tower forming part of the
Barracks; and general appearance of town picturesque.
See the mausoleum near to it, to the memory of the Howard
family, conspicuous on a lofty hill. The picturesque
and poetic tourist may amuse himself with tracing the romantic
scenery of the Avoca and Avonmore. See Ballyarthur,
the prospect from which, as described by Mr. Wakefield,
must not be omitted by the tourist. This view is best
seen from the terrace, which runs along the summit of the
northern bank that forms one side of the vale of Arklow.
The walk is 1 m. in length, with a summer house in one
part where the view is very fine, below which a slope of
great extent, clothed in wood, runs down to the united
streams of the Avoca and Derry, proceeding in one channel
into the ocean at Arklow. This hollow or valley is
much wider than to admit of being called a glen, being
about 1&frac12; m. in breadth; and from hence, looking directly
inland, is a fine extent of mountain scenery, the most conspicuous
feature of which is the Croan mountain fronting
a woody bank which forms part of the vale and extends
nearly 3 m. Following Mr. Wakefield's hints, the tourist
will now direct his eye down the glen, where the river is
seen pursuing its winding course until it is lost in cultivated
fields, bounded by rocky heights of various forms and tint.
On each side is a magnificent prospect of the ocean; and
more immediately to the left lies a most delightful rising
bank, covered with oaks, and forming the northern side of
the river. Here, says Mr. W., the lively appearance of the
woods, the tints of their waving foliage, the magnificence
of the mountain scenery, and the wide expanse of the ocean
displaying its surface, all combine to render this one of
those extraordinary scenes of nature which rivet the attention
with delight. The immediate foreground has a curious
effect, being formed of the tops of trees; whilst the
river lies below with slips of cultivated land scattered
about its banks, and encompassed by the most beautiful
woody scenery. Mr. W. then directs the tourist to follow
the course of the river in an opposite direction towards
Rathdrum, when the extent of the woods will almost induce
him to imagine himself in the midst of one of those
immense forests which extend over the wildest scenes of
nature. Here too a rapid river, flowing from the mountains,
rolls its shallow stream with wonderful rapidity
along its rough and pebbly bed; whilst the opposite side of
the glen is covered with wood to the very summit, behind
which are lofty mountains that seem almost to touch the
skies. Cross the river, pursue the road on the opposite
side, and particularly notice a beautiful view of both sides
of the glen in long perspective, with the river winding in
the bottom of it, and the sea terminating the prospect.
Visit Ballykin, seat of the Whaleys, erected on ancient Abbey.
At Ballyrane, a Danish rath in high preservation.
Carnew, 12 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span>, is a very strong situation, and was long
the head-quarters of the sept of O'Toole, who preserved
their independence for several centuries. It has a lofty
square Castle with towers and battlements, still in tolerable
preservation as far as regards the walls, which are of a
blueish stone and of very good workmanship. The turrets
are supported on consoles or brackets, and the whole has
a commanding appearance, but is disfigured by the
wretched cabins which crowd round the base of its venerable
walls. Also ruins of old Ch. From hence the tourist
may visit what remains of the ancient oak forest of
Shillelagh. Cronebane, 7 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> from Arklow, possesses
a mountain stream, a modern Pactolus, which separates the
counties of Wicklow and Wexford. In the bed of this
river large pieces of gold have several times been found;
but when a regular search was instituted, the quantity taken
did not pay the contingent expenses. Some lumps were
also found in the Wicklow side of the mountain; and the
tourist, if he picks up no specimens, may at least pick up
health and amusement in his search. The waters of this
place have been supposed to transmute iron into copper;
but the fact is, that they precipitate the contained copper
upon iron bars immersed therein; after which the precipitate
is fluxed, and yields about one half pure copper. Examine
the copper ore, which is found in one spot in a large
vein at the depth of 390 feet; also the mode of procuring
copper from the water, by its deposition on iron bars.
Cronbane-house is a mansion highly deserving of notice,
for its singular situation on a piece of land elevated, as Mr.
Wakefield describes it, to nearly half the height of the
mountain which forms the back-ground. The view from it
is very fine; for two rivers, the Avon and the Avoca, wind
round it in a semicircular form, exhibiting a broken outline,
which gives them a romantic appearance, and shrouding
the valley of Glendalough in their bosom. The home
grounds and walks also possess many beauties. Kilcarra
Castle, 3 m. from the sea, is the seat of the Earl of Carysfort,
lately ornamented with towers and castellated front;
in a retired spot on gentle declivity, with romantic glen.
The new mail-coach road leading past this district affords
many views of fine scenery. Shelton is the beautifully situated
mansion of the Earl of Wicklow, at the base of a
range of hills luxuriantly clothed in wood. Here are some
of the finest beeches and chestnuts in Ireland. House ancient
but modernized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baltinglass</span>, 17 m. <span class="smcap">W.</span> of Wicklow, is pleasantly seated
on the Slaney, with a good trade and some manufactures.
The Castle is in good repair, and now forms a comfortable
mansion. Near it, on the banks of the Slaney, are the remains
of the Abbey, consisting of a long Chapel totally in
ruins, with a belfry tower, and a lofty plain <span class="smcap">E.</span> window.
Part of it is still roofed, and fitted up for divine service.
Druidical remains in the vicinity; and the name is evidently
derived from the worship of Baal, or Apollo; a circumstance
that renders its antiquities highly interesting. Visit
from hence a very curious Rath at Donard, on a hill called
Slievh Guth or Church Mountain, about 6 m. distant. Here
is a holy well to which numerous pilgrims repair. Stratford
in the vicinity is a town of very recent erection, judiciously
planned, but not successful as it ought to be. The
cotton manufacture, however, flourishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessington</span>, 18 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span> of Wicklow, stands agreeably
on the Liffey, on the verge of the county, with a handsome
modern Ch.; and near it the ruins of the Marquis of Downshire's
noble mansion destroyed in the rebellion. Ballymore
Eustace has been already described in Kildare. Poll-a-phuca
may be visited from this place, with a curious
ruin of a Ch., and part of a Round Tower, and stone cross
near it. The cascade at this place is considered by Miss
Plumptre as much finer than the one at Powerscourt. It
is formed by the Liffey amongst abrupt rocky scenery, well
planted with shrubs, with shady walks, and prospect seats
arranged by the taste and liberality of the late Earl of Milton,
whose mansion at Russborough with a centre and
wings extending 700 feet, of the Corinthian and Ionic orders,
with a good collection of paintings, is worthy the
tourist's notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bray</span>, 13 m. <span class="smcap">N.</span> of Wicklow and 11 <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dublin, is a
place of considerable fashion in the summer as a bathing-place,
independent of its enchanting scenery and vicinity
to some of the sweetest charms of the county. See the
Martello Towers; also Bray-head, with marble and other
extensive quarries: old Castle; and river with good trout-fishing;
Ch. in bold romantic situation. A pleasant jaunt
is to go to Kilmacannoch Ch. in ruins, 3 m.; thence to the
Glen of the Downs; ascend a hill on the right, catching a
delightful view of Delganny Ch. on a rising hill above the
village, with the sea in the distance; thence proceed to
Newton Mount Kennedy, 8&frac12; m. from Bray, and to the vale
of Dunran; then 4&frac12; m. to the Devil's Glen, with fine
views of Glendaloch, Luggela, &amp;c.; further on to Rosanna
and Newry Bridge and Wicklow. The Dargle, a most romantic
glen about 1 m. in length, and amidst the Powerscourt
scenery, is one of the usual Irish wonders; but its
description would far exceed all possible limits. Let the
tourist attend to the fine ranges of wood; to the river in
the bottom tumbling from rock to rock; to the immense
height and grandeur of the precipices; and to the various
breaks of extended prospect which present themselves in
several directions. See Miss Plumptre's <i>Tour</i>, p. 83: also
further under <i>Powerscourt</i>. At Delgany, a handsome modern
Ch. with a superb monument to the memory of Mr.
Latouche. Ennisherry is a pretty little place much frequented
by invalids, standing near a river at the base of a
lofty hill. Near it is the Glen of the Downs, through which
runs the new mail-coach road to Wicklow. The best mode
of visiting this romantic spot is to proceed to Bellevue,
the seat of Mr. Latouche, which is about a mile from the
sea coast and commands a very fine view of Bray-head,
with an extent of marine scenery of considerable interest
stretching towards Wicklow-head. According to Mr.
Wakefield's description, the principal objects of attention,
on first entrance, are the green-houses, connected with the
mansion, and exhibiting to the delighted botanist a most
interesting display of exotics and tender indigenous plants,
some of them extremely rare. Behind the house, though
not within immediate view, is the Glen of the Downs. Proceed
to a banqueting-house in the pleasure-grounds, from
whence is a sudden but most delightful view of this romantic
scenery, lying directly below the observer, one side of
the glen lined with oaks, and the opposite rising into a
considerable hill clothed with rich foliage, and backed by
the lofty mountain of Thomond. The tourist, if returning
to Dublin, may proceed by Kilternan, 6&frac34; m. from the city,
1 m. beyond which is the Scalp, a remarkable chasm in a
mountain which appears as if rent asunder by an earthquake.
See the Sugar-Loaves in the distance. Near this
are the lead mines of Shankhill amidst granite rocks, with
abundance of galena, or sulphuret of lead, and mica. Collect
specimens of crystallizations of carbonate of lead;
also of sulphate of barytes, of phosphate of lead, and h&aelig;matite
or oxide of iron. Kilruddery near Bray, on the old
coach-road, is a romantic mansion seated in a deep valley
in the midst of most picturesque scenery. Luggela, which
may be visited from Powerscourt Park, has in its vicinity a
lake of the same name, seated amidst an ocean of mountainous
scenery, surrounded by dark and naked rocks, and
presenting a sombre picture of silence and desolation:
the rugged barrenness of the scene which encircles this
abyss is finely contrasted, in one point, by an expanse
of verdant lawn, together with some plantations, belonging
to a cottage erected there by Mr. Latouche, as a
banqueting retirement. A ride of a few miles, either from
Dublin or Bray, leads to Powerscourt, a noble seat, the
road to which is a glen between two vast ridges of mountains
covered with wood, which have a very noble effect.
The vale is no wider than to admit the road, a small gurgling
river close to its side, with some narrow slips of rocky
ground and shrubbery. The whole scenery is of a most magnificent
character, and much improved by an immense conical
mountain rising out of the glen, and seeming to forbid
all exit or entrance. An excursion to this favoured spot combines
within its arrangements the several beauties of the
Scalp, the Sugar-Loaf Mountains, and the Dargle: the
tourist may therefore bring them all within one day's visit,
if time is short, or visit them in detail after a general view.
The best method is to proceed from Dublin to Altadore,
after which the road for a few miles leads over mountain
scenery of a pleasing character until it approaches the head
of a wide extended glen, with the ocean in front and the
domain of Powerscourt covered with plantations and tillage;
whilst the Scalp, a lofty mountain, shuts up the view
in the north, and is finely contrasted on the opposite side
of the compass by the Sugar-Loaf. Let the tourist now
turn completely round, and he will discover a magnificent
glen, richly covered with foliage, with an astonishing waterfall
at its extremity, said to be 360 feet in height. Mr.
Wakefield observes that these objects, however, form only
a small part of the romantic scenery which fills this charming
district; and he says that in the extent of about 6 m.
from the Sugar-Loaf Mountains, and from the waterfall to
the ocean, a similar distance, nature has scattered her picturesque
beauties with so liberal a hand, that the view
altogether reminds the spectator of some of those landscapes
on canvas, in which the painter, indulging his genius,
has collected such an assemblage of interesting objects
as are seldom found combined together in nature.
The glen already described is the far famed <i>Dargle</i>, or
the <i>Glen of the Oaks</i>, so that it must have been as well
wooded in ancient times, as its sides are now clothed with
verdant oaks, which add considerably to its native beauties.
On a closer investigation the tourist observes a mountain
stream tumbling over its rocky bed with great rapidity,
after issuing from the foaming spray at the foot of the waterfall.
Let him then proceed to the Lover's-Leap, where
he will enjoy a most extensive prospect over the delightful
scenery of the woods beneath him. Turning to the right
he will notice the Powerscourt demesne, which includes a
park that extends from the waterfall to the spot on which
he stands, a distance of about 4 m., being an expanse of
ground exhibiting the most uneven and varied outline, and
richly planted with different trees and shrubs of the most
luxuriant growth. On all sides are deep glens whose sides
are covered with foliage, contrasted again by smiling
lawns; whilst the mansion itself, a noble edifice built of
the finest granite, is seen embosomed in trees, and overtopped
by lofty mountains in almost endless succession
and in all the variety of outline, blending their tints with
the ethereal vapours, and forming a most striking contrast
with the highly cultivated verdure of the foreground.
Formerly there was a most excellent station for the accommodation
of resident visitors, at an inn at Tinnehinch, but
the building has been fitted up as a villa by Mr. Grattan: the
tourist, however, will find other accommodation sufficiently
comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glendaloch</span> is a spot which cannot fail to excite high
interest in the minds of all persons of taste or enthusiasm;
for from the very earliest ages, Ledwich observes, it has
been the favourite seat of Superstition. If visited from
Wicklow, (from whence it is 11 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>,) proceed 2 m. to
Newry-bridge; see Glenmore Castle to the right, seat of
Mr. Synge; ascend an exceedingly steep hill, with fine prospect
looking back to the sea, but in front a brown dismal
waste, bordering on the Devil's Glen. Proceed across a
boggy flat, wild and dreary, towards Anamoe, where is a
curious square earthen embankment; the road dividing, on
the right to Luggela, on the left over a country dreary and
mountainous to the little village of Derrybaun at the confluence
of two mountain rivers, a short distance from
whence first gain a view of the once famous city, with its
tall Round Tower in the centre of a large wild valley, encircled
with vast rugged mountains. If you approach it
direct from Dublin by the new road, fail not to notice a
charming sheet of water, Lough Bray, with shores embraced
by stupendous cliffs, overtopped by lofty mountains.
If going by the Wicklow road, fail not to notice the Devil's
Glen, already mentioned, which Miss Plumptre considers as
the finest in the county. The vale is about 11 m. <span class="smcap">N.W.</span>
from Wicklow, and 22 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> from Dublin, from whence it forms
an agreeable morning ride, and is surrounded on all sides,
except to the <span class="smcap">E.</span>, by stupendous mountains, whose vast perpendicular
height throws a gloom on the deep dell below,
well suited to inspire religious dread and horror: for, being
covered with brown heath, or more sable peat, their summits
reflect no light whatever. As nothing facilitates the
observation of the tourist more readily than a clear idea of
the topography of the place he visits, it may now be stated
to him, that on entering the vale, he will perceive towards
the <span class="smcap">S.</span> the mountains Lugduff and Derrybaun, separated
only by a small cataract, opposite to which, and on the
other side of the lake, is Kemyderry, between which and
Broccagh on the north side is a road leading from Hollywood
to Wicklow. At the west end of the upper lake he
will observe a cascade called Glaneola Brook, falling from
the hill; and further on St. Kevin's Keeve, a small stream
from Glendason river, and in which Superstition still dips
weak and sickly children every Sunday and Thursday before
sunrise,&mdash;and certainly with an efficacy which an early cold
bath must produce on any other day of the week. Looking
into the bosom of the vale, the tourist will soon perceive
that these and other cataracts form a junction when
they assume the name of Avonmore or the Great River,
sometimes so swelled with torrents as to be rapid and dangerous,
but generally confined within narrower bounds, and
merely feeding two romantic little lakes separated from
each other by a rich and verdant meadow. It is evident
from the names of the mountains, that these eminences
were once a forest; but at present the gloom of foliage is
much wanted by the venerable ruins of the religious edifices,
or the "Seven Churches" that give so much interest
to the vale. Here once stood an extensive city, but
now almost extinct, except that from what can now be discovered
by its walls and foundations, it is conceived to have
extended from the "Refeart Church" to the "Ivy Church,"
on both sides of the river; and some idea of its ancient
state may be formed from its remains in the road leading
from the market-place into the county of Kildare, still in
good preservation, being paved with stones placed edgewise,
to the breadth of ten feet. Those who wish to know
all the superstitious traditions respecting this holy spot,
may consult the second article in <i>Ledwich's Antiquities of
Ireland</i>, where they are related. One of these, however,
must be noticed, as explanatory of one of the wonders of the
place. Tradition tells, and Superstition believes, that St.
Kevin, whilst ascending a neighbouring hill in a period of
scarcity and famine, met a woman with a sack on her head,
in which were five loaves. The woman, being rather
churlish, when the saint inquired the contents of her sack,
told him they were stones. "I pray they may be so," said
the holy inquirer, when instantly five stones tumbled out,
rolled towards Refeart Ch. where they were kept as sacred
reliques for many years, but are now exhibited in the valley,
weighing about twenty-eight pounds each, and certainly
bearing a great resemblance to loaves, from whence
this idle story has arisen. The tourist having now taken
a general survey of the place, it remains to lead him
through it in detail; and the first spot he meets, on approaching
from the <span class="smcap">E.</span> is the Ivy Ch., completely invested
with evergreen foliage, where he observes a circular belfry,
supposed by Ledwich to be one of the first attempts to
unite the Round Tower with the body of the Ch. Passing
on, or rather retracing his steps, a little to the <span class="smcap">S.E.</span> is seen
the eastern Ch. or Priory of St. Saviour, near which is a
stone-roofed Chapel. Resuming his former route, and
rambling about three hundred yards from the Ivy Ch., is a
small square which was the market-place of the ancient
city, with the pedestal of a stone Cross; to the southward
of which he may pass the river on stepping stones, the ruins
of a bridge, and then enter the solemn cemetery by a gateway
with a Saxon arch, when he arrives at the Cathedral,
evidently in the Saxon style of architecture. Here the <span class="smcap">E.</span>
window is deserving of notice from the curious sculptures
which adorn it, representing the most miraculous actions
of the patron saint. This window has the peculiarity of diminishing
in size, until it becomes so narrow as to be almost
impervious either to light or air; a peculiarity evidently
adopted from the want of glass. Here notice a tomb of
freestone on the <span class="smcap">S.</span> side of the choir: at a short distance,
the sacristy or priest's house, of which a closet, where the
vestments and holy utensils were kept, still remains, to turn
thrice round in which, is supposed by the vulgar to be a
certain cure for the head-ache; also some remnants of
crosses and sculptures worth noticing, particularly some
on the tombs of the O'Tooles, ancient Irish kings, here
and in the Lady's and Refeart Churches. Returning from
Refeart Ch., observe a circle of stones piled up conically
about three feet high, round which pilgrims still perform
penance; then on a recess of the southern mountain, see
St. Kevin's bed, excavated from the living rock in a projection
from the mountain, also Teanpell-na-Skellis Ch. But
the path to these holy curiosities is so evidently dangerous
and difficult, especially in returning, from its extreme narrowness,
that he who wishes to avoid the chance of a slip
into the lake below will be content to admire them at a
distance. Observe in the centre of the vale the ruins of
the Abbey, north of which is Trinity Ch. with part of a
Round Tower; also several smaller chapels and oratories.
If time will not permit the tourist to complete this investigation,
let him then approach this interesting scene by the
bridge of Derrybaun, from whence the Seven Churches
present a very picturesque and pleasing view. The bridge
itself is a pleasing object in the landscape, being a modern
erection of three elliptical arches over the Avonmore, covered
to a great extent with an oak coppice on one side
and the huge Broccagh on the other, which here confines
the view up the valley, at the end of which the great Round
Tower and other ruins appear to great advantage, whilst a
remarkably smooth and high mountain forms a most singular
and agreeable back-ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newton Mount Kennedy</span>, 7 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Bray, and 17
from Dublin, although placed here under a separate head,
may be included in the beauties round Powerscourt and the
Dargle. It is a pleasant village, on the mail-coach road,
half way between Bray and Wicklow, and may therefore
be made head-quarters, especially by the picturesque tourist,
and even by the traveller. The tourist whose time will
not permit visits beyond the immediate vicinity of the metropolis,
must not fail to inspect Mount Kennedy, the seat
of the late Lord Rosmore, to which there are few places in
Ireland superior in beauty. The house itself, a design of
Wyatt's, is finished in a high style of modern architecture;
and the principal front is simple, extremely light, but enriched
with an elegant portico of the Ionic order. It is
seated on an eminence, and to the rear, commands a fine
view of the sea at the distance of 2 m., whilst the country
which the eye runs over in the interval, is extremely
beautiful: from the principal front, looking towards the
west, is seen the demesne, bounded at some distance by
mountains which form a bold termination to the prospect.
At distances from the demesne are spots which present the
most striking scenes of natural beauty and ruggedness.
On these the taste and fancy of the late proprietor have
been exerted, so as to render them highly deserving the
tourist's notice, who must not omit to inquire for Dunran,
about 2 m. from the house, even if unable to visit the remaining
interesting objects. This place forms a prominent feature
in the list of curiosities to be visited in this very
picturesque county. Dunran is indeed, by its peculiar
beauties, rendered difficult to describe, and more appropriate
to the pencil than the pen. Here are 200 acres of
wood, water, rocks, and lawns highly dressed, in which the
bold ruggedness of nature has been softened by the hand of
culture so happily, as not to fritter away the characteristic
grandeur of the original; whilst each romantic eminence
presents a varied and extensive prospect of mountain,
vale, and wood of this beautiful county, at intervals contrasted
with the sublime and expansive line of the ocean.
This glen has many miles of road winding through it; and
the rambler will often find its deepest recesses enlivened
by the cheerful parties which frequent it during the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rathdrum</span>, 8 m. <span class="smcap">S.W.</span> of Wicklow, forms an excellent
station for the artist, with fine mountain and river scenery
on the Avon; with romantic mountains towards Arklow, covered
with luxuriant forests finely contrasting with the wild
and savage landscape in other parts of the vicinity. See
the Wool hill; some lead-mines near it, between which
and Rathdrum in the valley is a romantic bridge, which
Miss Plumptre strongly recommends as a subject for the
pencil. Visit the beautiful grounds of Avondale, 1 m.
distant: whilst here, the tourist will find a very agreeable
excursion in a trip to Glenmolaur, about 14 m. from Wicklow,
being a long strait glen, or valley, rude and barren,
with a rivulet wandering through it between two mountains,
whose tops are so broken and divided as to seem
like an extensive chain, yet the sides are so smooth and
steep that cattle frequently, by grazing too near, slip down
and are killed by the fall. At the entrance of the glen is a
lonely shepherd's cottage; and in proceeding towards its
termination, the visitor finds a rugged ascent formed of
huge pieces of rock loosely thrown together, whilst the
ascent opens into an ample cove, or kind of amphitheatre,
from the top of which descends a waterfall that feeds the
stream below, and though inconsiderable in dry seasons,
yet becomes a foaming cataract after heavy rains, adding
greatly to the romantic wildness of the scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wicklow</span>, 24 m. <span class="smcap">S.</span> of Dublin, stands agreeably on the
side of a lofty hill. Tolerably good accommodations. See
the Ch., with high steeple; modern Court-house; Gaol,
and Market-house; ruins of Black Castle, on a huge rock
rising from the sea; and some curious limestone caves at
the base of Wicklow-head. Some remains still exist of
the Abbey of Franciscan Friars, founded in the reign of
Henry III. Little more is left than masses of broken walls
with some fine arches; but being seated in private garden-ground,
they have of late years escaped dilapidation. Wicklow
ale is excellent. Ballybeg is a house and demesne near
Wicklow, which to the lovers of mountain scenery cannot
fail to afford gratification. Mr. Wakefield observes, that
although destitute of lake or river, yet the magnificent
prospect of mountain rising above mountain, until they
fade in the distance, presents quite an alpine view, the distant
hills clad with woody scenery, and the foreground well
filled up with thriving plantations, verdant lawns, and other
modern improvements. There is a very pleasant pedestrian
ramble to the Devil's Glen. On the right appears the sea
at some distance, extending from Wicklow-head to another
headland: beneath the observer's eye is the glen with a
mountain stream running along its bosom; beyond which
are cultivated hills, rocky promontories, and fine plantations
of evergreens surrounding the place of view;&mdash;the
whole forming a scene of great beauty.</p></blockquote>

order to enlarge the west end of the cathedral, which is
now repairing, after having lain in ruins for a great number
of years. And it is very remarkable, that under the
foundations of this tower, were found the vestiges of a more
ancient church, which appears to have been of exceeding
good masonry, and upon a larger scale than the present
old fabrick; in the walls of which there are many pieces of
cut stone, that have evidently been used in some former
building. The same circumstance may also be observed in
several of the ruined churches at Clonmacnoise.</p>
